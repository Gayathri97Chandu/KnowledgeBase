The concept codes mapped to specific MedDRA IDs were taken from the 
Standard Vocab v5 3/11/16 version using the following query:

COPY (
      select concept_id, concept_code from concept where concept.vocabulary_id = 'MedDRA'
     )
TO '/tmp/standard_vocab_to_meddra.csv' DELIMITER '|' CSV HEADER;
