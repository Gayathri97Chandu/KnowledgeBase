This mapping is from the standard vocabulary and comes from the
following query :

SELECT A.CONCEPT_CODE, A.CONCEPT_NAME, B.CONCEPT_CODE, B.CONCEPT_NAME, B.CONCEPT_ID, B.CONCEPT_CLASS_ID 
FROM CONCEPT A, CONCEPT B, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP CR
WHERE A.VOCABULARY_ID = 'Mesh' AND
      CR.CONCEPT_ID_2 = A.CONCEPT_ID AND 
      B.CONCEPT_ID = CR.CONCEPT_ID_1 AND
      B.VOCABULARY_ID = 'RxNorm' AND
      CR.RELATIONSHIP_ID = 'Mapped from';

The format (slightly edited from the exported results) is as follows:
source_concept_code|source_concept_name|concept_code|concept_name|concept_id|concept_class_id

...where source_concept_code is MeSH, concept_code is RxNorm, and concept_id is OHDSI/OMOP/IMEDS
