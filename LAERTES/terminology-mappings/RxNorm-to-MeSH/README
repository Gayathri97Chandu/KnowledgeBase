meddra-to-rxnorm-standard-vocab-v4.txt - This mapping is from the
standard vocabulary and comes from the following query which works
because MeSH drug concepts are ancestor to RxNorm Clinical Drug
concepts:

select map.source_code, map.source_code_description, concept.concept_code, concept.concept_name, concept.concept_id 
from source_to_concept_map as map, 
     concept_ancestor, 
     concept
where 
  map.mapping_type = 'DRUG' AND
  map.source_vocabulary_id = 46 AND 
  map.target_vocabulary_id = 8 AND
  map.target_concept_id = concept_ancestor.ancestor_concept_id AND
  concept_ancestor.descendant_concept_id = concept.concept_id;

The format is as follows:
source_code|source_code_description|concept_code|concept_name|concept_id 

...where source_code is MeSH, concept_code is RxNorm, and concept_id is OHDSI/OMOP/IMEDS
