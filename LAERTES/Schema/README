The relation and RDF Schemas for LAERTES
=========================================

Conceptually, the data model is a hybrid relational/RDF schema where
the RDF component applies the Open Data Annotation (OA) model
(http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) to represent specific
evidence items for or against an association between a drug and a
health outcome of interest (HOIs) from any of a variety of sources,
and the relational component provides a summary and index for drug-HOI
evidence represented in the RDF component.

The relational component extends the OHDSI Standard Vocabulary,
enumerates the evidence data sources, and provides counts for the
records associated with every drug-HOI pair in each source noting the
modality of the association (i.e., a positive or negative
association). Associated with the counts from a given source is a URL
that can be used in the RDF component to pull back a list of OA
records typed using custom OHDSI evidence types. Each OA record
provides data that client programs can use to render data about the
source of the evidence (the "target") and the semantic tags used to
identify the record as a source of evidence for a drug-HOI pair (the
"body" or "bodies").

This model decouples the data sources from the various copies of the
sources that might have been processed in many different ways. It also
decouples what can be said about and evidence item (i.e., the semantic
tags) from the information artifact. All of this allows for greater
flexibility with respect to inclusion of sources and
analysis. Moreover, the 'drill down' use case can be supported by
following URIs provided by in the 'evidence target' table to Linked
Data resources.

This model will be developed to support all of the sources here:
