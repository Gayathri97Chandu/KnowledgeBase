However,\nsleep and gender may influence therapeutic responses. We investigated the effects\nof a 2-week medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy on sleep and nocturnal\nbreathing in postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: A single-blind placebo-controlled trial was performed in 15\npostmenopausal women with moderate to severe COPD. A 12-week trial included\n2-week treatment periods with placebo and MPA (60 mg/d/14 days). All patients\nunderwent a polysomnography with monitoring of SaO2 and transcutaneous PCO2\n(tcCO2) at baseline, with placebo, with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 60\nmg/d/14 days), and three and six weeks after cessation of MPA.\nRESULTS: Thirteen patients completed the trial. At baseline, the average +/- SD\nof SaO2 mean was 90.6 +/- 3.2 % and the median of SaO2 nadir 84.8 %\n(interquartile range, IQR 6.1). MPA improved them by 1.7 +/- 1.6 %-units (95 %\nconfidence interval (CI) 0.56, 2.8) and by 3.9 %-units (IQR 4.9; 95% CI 0.24,\n10.2), respectively. The average of tcCO2 median was 6.0 +/- 0.9 kPa and\ndecreased with MPA by 0.9 +/- 0.5 kPa (95% CI -1.3, -0.54). MPA improved SaO2\nnadir and tcCO2 median also during REM sleep. Three weeks after cessation of MPA,\nthe SaO2 mean remained 1.4 +/- 1.8 %-units higher than at baseline, the\ndifference being not significant (95% CI -0.03, 2.8). SaO2 nadir was 2.7 %-units \n(IQR 4.9; 95% CI 0.06, 18.7) higher than at baseline. Increases in SaO2 mean and \nSaO2 nadir during sleep with MPA were inversely associated with baseline SaO2\nmean (r = -0.70, p = 0.032) and baseline SaO2 nadir (r = -0.77, p = 0.008),\nrespectively. Treatment response in SaO2 mean, SaO2 nadir and tcCO2 levels did\nnot associate with pack-years smoked, age, BMI, spirometric results or sleep\nvariables.\nCONCLUSION: MPA-induced respiratory improvement in postmenopausal women seems to \nbe consistent and prolonged. The improvement was greater in patients with lower\nbaseline SaO2 values. Long-term studies in females are warranted.\n\nPMCID: PMC1079947\nPMID: 15807890  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Daytime PaO(2) improved with acetazolamide from \n65.2 +/- 2.3 to 75.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg (p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes\nwere seen with MPA. Mean nocturnal end-tidal carbon dioxide tension decreased\nwith both treatments, from 42.0 +/- 2.3 to 35.3 +/- 2.3 mm Hg with acetazolamide \n(p < 0.05) and to 34.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg with MPA (p < 0.05). The percentage of time \nthat the nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation was < 90% was reduced significantly\nwith acetazolamide, from 34.9 +/- 10.7% to 16.3 +/- 7.5% (p < 0.05). Mean\nnocturnal saturation did not change with MPA. Resting minute ventilation\nincreased significantly only with MPA from 9.6 +/- 0.7 to 10.8 +/- 0.8 L/min (p <\n0.05). The slope of the hypercapnic ventilatory response did not change during\nacetazolamide and MPA therapy. The hypoxic ventilatory response increased from - \n0.2 +/- 0.05 to - 0.4 +/- 0.1 L/min/% during acetazolamide (p < 0.05) and to -\n0.3 +/- 0.1 L/min/% during MPA (p < 0.05). The hypoxic P(0.1) response improved\nwith acetazolamide treatment from - 0.05 +/- 0.008 to - 0.15 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/% (p \n< 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that acetazolamide and MPA both have favorable\neffects on daytime and nighttime blood gas parameters in ventilatory-limited\npatients with stable COPD. However, the use of acetazolamide is preferred because\nof its extra effect on nocturnal saturation.\n\nPMID: 12740260  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Leptin and its counterpart neuropeptide Y\n(NPY) have recently been linked with respiration. The effect of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on arterial blood gases, serum leptin and NPY\nwas evaluated in this study. Fourteen postmenopausal females with respiratory\nimpairment, due mostly to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were recruited\nfor a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Arterial\nblood gases, serum leptin and NPY concentrations were measured at baseline and\nafter 14 days of treatment with placebo and MPA, separated by a 6-week washout\nperiod. Thirteen patients completed the trial. The mean+/-SD carbon dioxide\ntension in arterial blood (Pa,CO2) was 5.4+/-0.6 kPa at baseline, and decreased\nby 0.8+/-0.3 kPa during treatment with MPA. The oxygen tension in arterial blood \n(Pa,O2) and pH did not change. At baseline, the mean base excess was 0.6+/-1.9\nmmol x L(-1) and the mean bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration was 25.1+/-1.6 mmol x\nL(-1). With MPA, base excess decreased by 2.2+/-1.2 mmol x L(-1) and HCO3- by\n1.9+/-1.0 mmol x L(-1) from baseline. The mean concentrations of serum leptin\n(19.8+/-9.9 microg x L(-1) at baseline, 19.7+/-9.8 microg x L(-1) with MPA) or\nNPY (94.0+/-18.3 pmol x L(-1) at baseline, 85.1+/-41.2 pmol x L(-1) with MPA) did\nnot change. However, the reduction in Pa,CO2 correlated with the reduction of\nserum leptin concentration. Medroxyprogesterone acetate effectively decreased the\ncarbon dioxide tension in postmenopausal females with chronic respiratory\nimpairment. The results suggest that a decrease in the carbon dioxide tension of \n> or = 0.9 kPa is necessary for a reduction in serum leptin concentration.\n\nPMID: 12503697  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In a double-blind randomised study, the\neffects of a 2-week treatment with MPA (30 mg b.i.d.) or ACET (250 mg b.i.d.),\nfollowed by a 2-week treatment with a combination of both drugs (MPA/ACET), on\ndaytime and nocturnal ventilatory and blood gas parameters in 17 stable\nhypercapnic COPD patients were investigated. ACET, MPA and MPA/ACET treatment\ndecreased mean daytime carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood by 0.4, 0.7 and\n1.2 kPa, respectively. Minute ventilation was improved only with combined\ntherapy, from 9.3 to 11.2 L x min(-1). With MPA/ACET therapy, the hypercapnic and\nhypoxic ventilatory responses significantly increased, from 3.7 to 5.8 L x\nmin(-1) x kPa(-1) and from -0.13 to -0.40 L x min(-1) x %(-1), respectively. The \nmouth exclusion pressure response to hypoxia increased during combination\ntherapy, from -0.01 to -0.03 kPa %(-1). Nocturnal end-tidal carbon dioxide\ntension decreased with MPA and MPA/ACET treatment, by 0.9 and 1.4 kPa,\nrespectively. MPA/ACET significantly increased mean nocturnal arterial oxygen\nsaturation values, from 85.5 to 90.2%. The authors conclude that short-term\ncombined treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and acetazolamide has a more \nfavourable effect on day and night-time blood gas values and chemical drive than \nsingle drug treatment.\n\nPMID: 12449165  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We evaluated treatment efficacy and fertility\noutcomes in this population.\nMETHODS: Women <45 y treated with oral progestin for CAH or G1EC were identified \nfrom two cancer centers. Data were obtained from medical records and telephone\nquestionnaires. Time until complete response (CR), and from CR until recurrence\nwas censored for patients without events and analyzed for associations with\npatient and treatment characteristics; cumulative incidence functions were used\nto estimate event probability over time.\nRESULTS: 44 patients were identified, 19 (43%) with CAH and 25 (57%) with G1EC.\nMedian age was 36.5 y (26-44). 24 (55%) achieved CR (median time: 5.7 months).\nOlder age was associated with a lower likelihood of CR (HR 0.84, p=0.0003, 95%\nCI, 0.8-0.9). CR probability appeared to plateau after 12 months of therapy.\nAmong those with CR, 13 (54%) recurred (median time 3.5 y). 24 patients (55%)\nunderwent hysterectomy; 3 (13%) were upstaged. 11 (25%) underwent fertility\ntreatment with the following outcomes: 6 (55%) no pregnancy, 2 (18%) at least one\nlive infant, and 3 (27%) spontaneous abortion. One achieved a live birth without \nintervention.\nCONCLUSION: Oral progestin is an effective temporizing fertility-sparing\ntreatment for women with CAH/G1EC. Fertility specialist involvement is\nrecommended due to the low live birth rate without intervention. Progestin\ntherapy should be re-evaluated at 1 year in non-responders due to a low\nprobability of success. Hysterectomy is recommended after childbearing due to a\nhigh recurrence rate.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nPMID: 24561246  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Follow-up was performed\nprimarily with imaging techniques followed by endometrial biopsy when indicated.\nRESULTS: The median age was 30 years (range, 23-40 years). Fourteen patients\n(29.2%) received daily oral megestrol acetate (median dose 160 mg per day, range \n40-240 mg per day) and 34 (70.8%) received daily oral medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(median dose 500 mg per day, range 80-1,000 mg per day). Complete responses were \nobserved for 37 patients (77.1%) after the median treatment duration of 10 months\n(range 3-20 months). Complete response rates were 76.5%, 73.9%, and 87.5% for\npatients with stage IA, grade 2-3 without myometrial invasion (n=17), for\npatients with stage IA, grade 1 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=23), and \nfor patients with stage IA, grade 2-3 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=8),\nrespectively (P=.731). Recurrence rates for 37 patients who achieved complete\nresponse after a median follow-up time of 48 months (range 7-136 months) were\n23.1%, 47.1%, and 71.4%, respectively (P=.104). None experienced disease\nprogression or died of the disease. Nine patients gave birth to 10 healthy\nnewborns.\nCONCLUSION: Progestin treatment appears to be reasonably effective for patients\nwith stage IA, grade 2-3 differentiation without myometrial invasion and patients\nwith stage IA grade 1 differentiation with superficial myometrial invasion.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.\n\nPMID: 23743459  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub\n2009 Dec 4.\n\nEfficacy of venlafaxine, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate for\nthe treatment of vasomotor hot flushes in men taking gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone analogues for prostate cancer: a double-blind, randomised trial.\n\nIrani J(1), Salomon L, Oba R, Bouchard P, Mottet N.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Urology Unit, University Hospital, Poitiers, France. j.irani@chu-poitiers.fr\n\nComment in\n    Lancet Oncol. 2010 Feb;11(2):107-8.\n\nBACKGROUND: Hot flushes are the most common complaints reported by men undergoing\nandrogen suppression treatment for prostate cancer. We designed a randomised\ndouble-blind trial to compare the efficacy of three drugs, each of which has\nproven effective for preventing hot flushes in previous studies.\nMETHODS: Men with prostate cancer with an indication for androgen suppression\nwere enrolled in the study at 106 urology centres in France between April 14,\n2004, and April 20, 2007. All patients were treated for 6 months with leuprorelin\n(11.25 mg). At month 6, patients who spontaneously asked for treatment, or those \nwho presented with 14 hot flushes or more during the week before the visit, were \nrandomly assigned to either venlafaxine 75 mg daily, medroxyprogesterone acetate \n20 mg daily, or cyproterone acetate 100 mg daily. All patients received two\nindistinguishable pills in the morning and one in the evening from week 1 to week\n8, and one indistinguishable pill in the morning from week 9 to week 10, to\ncomply with the double-blind design. Random assignment with a block size of three\nwas done centrally, by fax, and each patient was given a randomisation number.\nThe allocation sequence was stratified by centre. Assessment was done at\ninclusion, at randomisation, and then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after\nrandomisation. Participants completed a daily hot-flush diary for 1 week, and a\nquality of life questionnaire before each visit throughout the study. The primary\noutcome was the change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation and \n1 month. All patients who received at least one study treatment dose were\nincluded in the efficacy analysis. This trial is registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01011751.\nFINDINGS: Of the 919 men initially enrolled, 311 were randomly assigned to one of\nthe study treatments at 6 months: 102 to venlafaxine, 101 to cyproterone, and 108\nto medroxyprogesterone. 309 patients were included in the efficacy analysis,\nsince two were excluded for protocol deviations (one in the cyproterone and one\nin the medroxyprogesterone group; both were excluded because they were already\nundergoing treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants at\nrandomisation). The change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation \nand 1 month was -47.2% (IQR -74.3 to -2.5) in the venlafaxine group, -94.5%\n(-100.0 to -74.5) in the cyproterone group, and -83.7% (-98.9 to -64.3) in the\nmedroxyprogesterone group. The decrease from baseline was significant for all\nthree groups (p<0.0001). Pairwise comparison of treatment groups adjusted by the \nBonferroni method confirmed that the decreases in hot-flush score were\nsignificantly larger in the cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone groups than in\nthe venlafaxine group, regardless of the interval considered (p<0.0001 in all\ncases). There was no significant difference between the cyproterone and\nmedroxyprogesterone groups (p>0.2 in all cases). Serious side-effects occurred in\nfour, seven, and five patients in the venlafaxine, cyproterone, and\nmedroxyprogesterone groups, respectively, of which none, one (dyspnoea), and one \n(urticaria) were considered related to the drug, respectively.\nINTERPRETATION: After 6 months of treatment with leuprorelin, venlafaxine,\ncyproterone, and medroxyprogesterone proved to be effective in reducing hot\nflushes. However, the hormonal treatments cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone\nwere significantly more effective than venlafaxine. As cyproterone is a\nrecognised treatment in prostate cancer, and its use could interfere with\nhormonal therapy, medroxyprogesterone could be considered to be the standard\ntreatment for hot flushes in men undergoing androgen suppression for prostate\ncancer.\nFUNDING: Takeda Laboratories, Puteaux, France.\n\nCopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, graphic display of time-to-event data usually takes the form \nof a Kaplan-Meier survival plot. Kaplan-Meier plots, however, make differences\nbetween groups seem larger than they really are. To overcome these limitations,\nwe developed a technique for producing scatter plots with survival data and\napplied it to data from a randomized trial of patients with renal cancer. As of\nJune 21, 2001, 25 of the 347 patients with kidney cancer in the Medical Research \nCouncil RE01 randomized treatment trial for whom data were available had been\ncensored, and the remainder had died. Values of the censored survival times were \nimputed by assuming a log-normal distribution in survival times and by drawing a \nrandom sample given that that each patient with censored data survived at least\nto the point of censoring. The combined original and imputed data were then\nexamined by use of dot plots and scatter plots. In the RE01 trial, median\nsurvival of patients treated with interferon was 3.0 months (95% confidence\ninterval = 0.3 to 5.5 months) longer than that in patients treated with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed clear separation\nbetween treatment groups and between prognostic groups. In contrast, comparisons \nof individual observed and imputed survival times between groups of patients\nshowed considerable overlap and gave a more realistic idea of the modest\nbetween-group differences than Kaplan-Meier comparisons. These graphs of the\ndistribution of survival times for individuals in each study group, which are\nsimple to produce, may usefully complement Kaplan-Meier plots.\n\nPMID: 18182621  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The Programme Etude Rein Cytokines (PERCY)\nQuattro trial was designed to evaluate both cytokines for their survival benefit \nto intermediate prognosis patients, who represent the majority of candidates for \nthese treatments.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized in a 2-by-2 factorial design to\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate 200 mg daily, interferon-alfa 9 million IU 3 times a \nweek, subcutaneous interleukin-2 9 million IU daily, or a combination of both\ncytokines. Tumor response was evaluated at Week 12 and Month 6; progression-free \npatients received further identical treatment for a maximum of 3 additional\nmonths. Primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints were\ndisease-free survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life. Survival was\nanalyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nRESULTS: From January 2000 to July 2004, 492 patients were enrolled. Analysis was\nperformed after a 29.2-month median follow-up (range, 0 months to 54.6 months).\nThere were no significant survival differences between the 244\ninterferon-alfa-treated patients and 248 noninterferon-alfa patients (hazard\nratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81-1.24) or between the 247 interleukin-2 and 245\nnoninterleukin-2-treated patients (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87-1.33; log\nrank, 0.99 and 0.52, respectively). Grade 3-4 toxicities were significantly more \nfrequent in cytokine-treated patients than in medroxyprogesterone-treated\npatients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous interleukin-2 and/or interferon-alfa provide no\nsurvival benefit in metastatic renal cancers of intermediate prognosis, and they \ninduce a significant risk of toxicity. Newly available angiogenesis inhibitors\nshould be preferred for these patients.\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 American Cancer Society.\n\nPMID: 17932908  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Twenty-eight patients having EC at presumed stage IA and\n17 patients with AH at younger than 40 years of age were enrolled. All patients\nwere given a daily oral dose of 600 mg of MPA with low-dose aspirin. This\ntreatment continued for 26 weeks, as long as the patients responded. Histologic\nchange of endometrial tissue was assessed at 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. Either \nestrogen-progestin therapy or fertility treatment was provided for the responders\nafter MPA therapy. The primary end point was a pathologic complete response (CR) \nrate. Toxicity, pregnancy rate, and progression-free interval were secondary end \npoints.\nRESULTS: CR was found in 55% of EC cases and 82% of AH cases. The overall CR rate\nwas 67%. Neither therapeutic death nor irreversible toxicities were observed;\nhowever, two patients had grade 3 body weight gain, and one patient had grade 3\nliver dysfunction. During the 3-year follow-up period, 12 pregnancies and seven\nnormal deliveries were achieved after MPA therapy. Fourteen recurrences were\nfound in 30 patients (47%) between 7 and 36 months.\nCONCLUSION: The efficacy of fertility-sparing treatment with a high-dose of MPA\nfor EC and AH was proven by this prospective trial. Even in responders, however, \nclose follow-up is required because of the substantial rate of recurrence.\n\nPMID: 17602085  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Tibolone was compared with continuous combined\nconjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (0.625 + \n2.5 mg/d).\nMETHODS: Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to tibolone 1.25 mg/d, 2.5\nmg/d, and CEE/MPA, respectively. The one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) has\nbeen evaluated for the incidence of abnormal endometrial histology (hyperplasia\nor carcinoma) and hyperplasia and carcinoma separately for each of the two\ntreatment groups and the treatment groups combined after 1 and 2 yr of treatment \nwith tibolone, compared with CEE/MPA.\nRESULTS: A total of 3240 women were randomized, with 3224 receiving at least one \ndose of study medication. The incidence and upper one-sided 95% CI for the\nincidence of abnormal endometrium (hyperplasia or carcinoma), and hyperplasia and\ncarcinoma separately, were calculated at end point, yr 1, and yr 2. The incidence\n(upper one-sided 95% CI) of abnormal endometrium at end point was 0.0 (0.5), 0.0 \n(0.4), and 0.2 (0.5) in the tibolone 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and CEE/MPA groups,\nrespectively. During the entire treatment period, amenorrhea was reported more\nfrequently with tibolone 1.25 mg (78.7%) and 2.5 mg (71.4%) than CEE/MPA (44.9%).\nCONCLUSION: The Tibolone Histology of the Endometrium and Breast Endpoints Study \nresults confirm previous findings that tibolone does not induce endometrial\nhyperplasia or carcinoma in postmenopausal women, and it is associated with a\nbetter vaginal bleeding profile than CEE/MPA.\n\nPMID: 17192288  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Eligible participants\nhad a cervical smear within 1 year before randomization and at 3- and 6-year\nfollow-ups. Outcomes measured were low-grade and high-grade squamous\nintraepithelial lesions (LSIL, HSIL) and cervical cancer at follow-up years 3 and\n6.\nRESULTS: Of 15,733 eligible participants with a uterus, 7,663 were assigned to\nplacebo and 8,070 to estrogen plus progestin. At baseline, 318 women (2%) had\nlow-grade abnormalities on cervical cytology. The annual incidence rate of any\nnew cytological abnormality in the estrogen plus progestin group was\nsignificantly higher than that in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.4, 95%\nconfidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.6). Independent risk factors for HSIL and cervical\ncancer over a 6-year follow-up (after stratifying for baseline cytologic\nabnormalities) included sexual activity in the past year while not being married \nor living as married (hazard ratio 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.3). Risk factors did not\ninclude age or use of estrogen plus progestin.\nCONCLUSION: Use of estrogen plus progestin was associated with increased\nincidence of any cytologic abnormality, although it had no impact on the\nincidence of HSIL or cervical cancer. Sexually active older women who are not\nmarried or living as married may benefit from continued cervical cancer\nscreening.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov,\nNCT00000611.\n\nPMID: 16880313  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In the\nthalidomide arm, there was no objective response seen. The best response was SD\nin three patients lasting 5+, 6+, and 12 months, respectively. All patients in\nthe medroxyprogesterone arm progressed. There was no difference in overall\nsurvival between the two arms; median survival in the thalidomide arm was 8.2\nmonths compared with 4.8 months in the medroxyprogesterone arm (P = .62). Hazard \nratio was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.94). Median duration of treatment was 73 days\n(range, 14 to 364 days) in the thalidomide arm, and 84 days (range, 7 to 175\ndays) in the medroxyprogesterone arm. The high incidence of toxicity in the\nthalidomide arm, mainly somnolence, constipation, fatigue and paraesthesia, meant\nthat only 30.8% of patients were able to tolerate the maximum dose of 400 mg/d of\ntreatment.\nCONCLUSION: Thalidomide is not superior to medroxyprogesterone acetate in\npatients with metastatic RCC. Its risk/benefit ratio does not favor its use in\nthis patient population.\n\nPMID: 16484699  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A new approach to the investigation of interactions.\n\nRoyston P(1), Sauerbrei W, Ritchie A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Cancer Division, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, 222 Euston Road, London NW1 2DA, UK.\npr@ctu.mrc.ac.uk\n\nThe first analysis of the MRC RE01 trial in metastatic renal carcinoma identified\na 28% reduction in the hazard of death for patients treated with interferon-alpha\ncompared with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). No subgroup was identified in\nwhich treatment with interferon-alpha was more or less effective than MPA. We\nused a new approach based on fractional polynomials to investigate the updated\ndata from this trial for the possible interaction of treatment with prognostic\nfactors. In the spirit of hypothesis generation, we considered 10 possible\nprognostic variables, of which white cell count (WCC) was found to influence the \neffectiveness of interferon treatment. In patients treated with MPA, there was no\nprognostic effect of WCC, whereas, in patients treated with interferon, the risk \nof dying increased significantly with WCC level. We defined subgroups of patients\nbased on WCC levels and estimated a hazard ratio of 0.53 in favour of interferon \nin patients with WCC <6.5 x 10(9), whereas for patients with WCC >10 x 10(9) the \nrisk appears to be similar between the treatment groups, or even slightly raised \nin the interferon group. Since our results are derived from flexible statistical \nmodels, they may be interpreted as a new hypothesis and require validation in\nindependent data.\n\nPMCID: PMC2410187\nPMID: 14970855  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Roffo Cancer Institute, University of Buenos\nAires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nComment in\n    J Pain Symptom Manage. 2004 Sep;28(3):195-7; author reply 197-8.\n\nSystemic syndromes characterized by a persistent activity of circulating\nmediators (cytokines) are frequently present with advanced cancer. We grouped\nunder the general heading of "Systemic Immune-Metabolic Syndrome (SIMS)" a\nparticular variety of distressing systemic syndrome characterized by\ndysregulation of the psycho-neuro-immune-endocrine homeostasis, with overlapping \nclinical manifestations. SIMS may include cachexia, anorexia, nausea, early\nsatiety, fatigue, tumor fever, cognitive changes and superinfection. The aim of\nthis study was to ameliorate some of the SIMS symptoms in a homogeneous group of \nlung adenocarcinoma patients using a multitargeted therapy. Fifteen patients with\nevidence of SIMS were studied. SIMS was defined as the presence of weight loss,\nanorexia, fatigue performance status>/=2 and acute-phase protein response.\nPatients received medroxyprogesterone (MPA) (500 mg twice daily), celecoxib (200 \nmg twice daily), plus oral food supplementation for 6 weeks. After treatment, 13 \npatients either had stable weight (+/- 1%) or had gained weight. There were\nsignificant differences in improvement of body-weight-change rate, nausea, early \nsatiety, fatigue, appetite and performance status. Patients who had any kind of\nlung infection showed higher levels of IL-10 compared to non-infected patients\n(P=0.039). Our results suggest that patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma,\ntreated with MPA, celecoxib and dietary intervention, might have considerable\nimprovement in certain SIMS outcomes. This multitargeted symptomatic approach\ndeserves further study.\n\nPMID: 14711473  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Unfortunately the promising results obtained in biological studies have\nnot yet been confirmed in clinical studies. One reason is linked to the\nimmunosuppression of metastatic patients which is caused by macrophage products. \nIL-6 in particular is considered a growth factor for RCC. Medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) may interfere with IL-6 macrophage production, possibly causing a\nsynergistic effect in association with IL-2 and IFN-alpha. Therefore the purpose \nof our study was to evaluate the toxicity and the efficacy of the association\nbetween IL-2, IFN-alpha and MPA.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with metastatic RCC were\nenrolled. IL-2 was administered subcutaneously at doses of 4.5 million UI on days\n1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26; IFN-alpha was administered s.c. at a dose of 3\nmillion t.t.w; MPA was administered orally at a dose of 1000 mg daily. This\nschedule was repeated after a rest of 2 weeks.\nRESULTS: Toxicity was mild: the main symptoms observed were fatigue and fever.\nSix CR (14%), five PR (12%), thirteen SD (31%) and seventeen PD (41%) were\nobserved for an overall response rate of 26%. Patients with good PS and low\nlevels of CRP had a better prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: Considering both the good activity and the low toxicity of this\nscheme, we think that it could be carried out in normal clinical practice.\n\nPMID: 12530040  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The study\nincluded 34 patients with histologically--confirmed AH and 86--CAC (stage I-II\nand III-IV). All patients were given preoperative "shock therapy" with a\ncombination of progestins and anticoagulants: 500 mg, i.v., 10 days--(AH) and\nwell-differentiated cell CAC; 20 days--moderately- and poorly-differentiated cell\nCAC. Total dose was 5 g and 10 g, respectively. Fibrolysin, pelentan and aspirin \n(antiaggregant of thrombocytes) were used as anticoagulants. For comparison,\nidentical numbers of AH and CAC patients received similar preoperative progestin \ntherapy without anticoagulants. The study was randomized.

Both parenteral and oral progestins yield similar serum\nlevels and response rates, which range from 18% to 34%. The one major study that \nused oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) noted a response rate at the lower\nend of the range (18%) and much poorer progression-free and overall survival\ntimes (4 and 10.5 months, respectively) than previously reported. The present\nstudy sought to confirm this earlier study of oral MPA, to assess the importance \nof prognostic factors such as histologic grade and receptor levels, and to\ndetermine whether a higher dose of MPA would yield a higher response rate.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-nine eligible women with advanced or\nrecurrent endometrial carcinoma were randomized to receive oral MPA either 200\nmg/d or 1, 000 mg/d until unacceptable toxicity intervened or their disease\nprogressed.\nRESULTS: Among 145 patients receiving the low-dose regimen, there were 25\ncomplete (17%) and 11 partial (8%) responses for an overall response rate of 25%.\nThe 154 patients receiving the high-dose regimen experienced 14 (9%) complete and\n10 (6%) partial responses for an overall response rate of 15%. Median durations\nof progression-free survival were 3.2 months and 2.5 months for the low-dose and \nhigh-dose regimens, respectively. Median survival durations were 11.1 months and \n7.0 months, respectively. The adjusted relative odds of responding to the\nhigh-dose regimen compared with the low-dose regimen was 0.61 (90% confidence\ninterval, 0.36 to 1.04). Prognostic factors having a significant impact on the\nprobability of response included initial performance status, age, histologic\ngrade, and progesterone receptor concentration. Compliance with oral therapy was \ndocumented with serum levels 1 month after starting therapy, when possible. MPA\nlevels were commensurate with the assigned dose and schedule.\nCONCLUSION: Oral MPA is active against endometrial carcinoma. Response to\nprogestin therapy is more frequent among patients with a well-differentiated\nhistology and positive progesterone receptor status. This study provides no\nevidence to support the use of MPA 1,000 mg/d orally instead of MPA 200 mg/d\norally. In fact, the trends suggest the opposite. The use of oral MPA 200 mg/d is\na reasonable initial approach to the treatment of advanced or recurrent\nendometrial carcinoma, particularly those lesions that are well-differentiated\nand/or progesterone receptor-positive (> 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein). Patients\nwith poorly differentiated and/or progesterone receptor levels less than 50\nfmol/mg cytosol protein had only an 8% to 9% response rate.\n\nPMID: 10561210  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Medical Research Council Renal Cancer Collaborators.\n\n[No authors listed]\n\nComment in\n    Lancet. 1999 Jan 2;353(9146):6-7.\n\nBACKGROUND: Metastatic renal carcinoma has a 2-year survival of around 20% and is\nlargely resistant to chemotherapy. The use of interferons in the treatment of\nmetastatic renal carcinoma remains controversial. Although non-randomised studies\nsuggest that biological therapy with interferons produces a small number of\ntumour responses, most clinicians judge such treatment to be ineffective. We have\ninvestigated the effect of treatment with interferon-alpha on survival in\npatients with metastatic renal carcinoma.\nMETHODS: In a multicentre, randomised trial, patients with metastatic renal\ncarcinoma were randomly assigned subcutaneous interferon-alpha (three doses--5\nMU, 5 MU, 10 MU--for the first week, then 10 MU three times per week for a\nfurther 11 weeks; n=174) or oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 300 mg once\ndaily for 12 weeks; n=176). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis\nwas by intention to treat. The trial used a triangular sequential design for\nearly termination as soon as results were conclusive. The trial was stopped in\nNovember, 1997, when data were available for 335 patients (167 interferon-alpha, \n168 MPA).\nFINDINGS: A total of 111 patients have died in the interferon-alpha group, and\n125 patients have died in the MPA group. There was a 28% reduction in the risk of\ndeath in the interferon-alpha group (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.55-0.94],\np=0.017). Interferon-alpha gave an improvement in 1-year survival of 12% (MPA 31%\nsurvival, interferon-alpha 43%), and an improvement in median survival of 2.5\nmonths (MPA 6 months, interferon-alpha 8.5 months).\nINTERPRETATION: The benefit of treatment with interferon-alpha should be weighed \nagainst the drug's toxic effects. Combination regimens of biological therapy and \nchemotherapy should now be compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in\nrandomised controlled trials.\n\nPMID: 10023944  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There\nwere no objective responders among the eight patients treated with recombinant\ngamma-interferon at an i.v. dose of 1 mg/m(2) daily for five days every other\nweek for four weeks then 1 mg/m(2) three times a week given every other week\nuntil there was documented disease progression or complete response (CR). Overall\nmedian survival was 17.3 months (range 1.4 to 184). The major side effects of\ntreatment included fever/chills (75%), mild anorexia and fatigue (75%),\nnausea/vomiting (80%), leukopenia (38%), and abnormal liver function tests (25%).\nThere were no life-threatening side effects observed. At our institution, in a\nrandom cohort of eight patients with metastatic RCC, recombinant gamma-interferon\nwhen given at a dose of 1 mg/m(2) per day given three times per week on an every \nother week schedule yields no clinical antitumor activity. A review of the\nliterature on the use of gamma-interferon for metastatic RCC suggests that\nlow-dose combination therapy with other cytokines may yield the best\nresponse-to-side effect ratio. Higher doses yield more responses but an added\ncost of more toxicity.\n\nPMID: 8610639  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

WHO Collaborative Study of\nNeoplasia and Steroid Contraceptives.\n\nThomas DB(1), Ray RM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.\n\nA hospital-based case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Bangkok,\nThailand, and in one hospital each in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Mexico City, Mexico\nand Nairobi, Kenya. One purpose of this study was to determine whether the\nlong-acting progestational contraceptive, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(DMPA), alters risk of invasive cervical carcinomas with adenomatous histological\nfeatures. Information on prior use of DMPA, screening for cervical cancer, and\nthe suspected risk factors for this disease was ascertained from interviews of\n239 women with adenocarcinomas and 85 women with adenosquamous carcinomas, as\nwell of from a large pool of controls, 2534 of whom were matched to the cases\nincluded in this report. For selected subsets of these women, a smoking history\nwas also elicited, blood specimens were collected for measurement of antibodies\nagainst herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus, and information on sexual behavior\nwas obtained from interviews of their husbands. The relative risk (and 95%\nconfidence interval) of adenomatous cervical carcinomas in women who ever used\nDMPA was estimated to be 0.75 (0.51, 1.11). No trends in risk were observed with \nduration of DMPA use, times since first or last use, or age at first use. The\nresults provide reassurance that use of DMPA for over four years does not enhance\nrisk of adenomatous cervical carcinomas, and risk is not increased after a\npotential latent period of over 12 years since initial exposure.\n\nPMID: 8585888  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

So far, no randomized prospective trials including\nuntreated control groups have been reported. We present a prospective study\ncomparing IFN-alpha and vinblastine (VBL) versus medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MPA).\nMETHODS: Immunochemotherapy schedule consists of IFN-alpha 8 million U/day\nsubcutaneously for 3 days per week and VBL 0.1 mg/kg body weight intravenously at\n3-week intervals. MPA was administrated intramuscularly at a dosage of 500\nmg/week. The response rates, toxicities, and actuarial overall survival were\nanalyzed.\nRESULTS: The overall response rate in 41 patients receiving IFN-alpha and VBL\ntreatment was 20.5% (95% confidence interval, 9% to 33%). Four patients reached a\ncomplete and 5 patients reached a partial remission. No remissions were observed \nin 35 patients of the control group. A statistically significant survival benefit\nfor the IFN-alpha and VBL group could not be demonstrated. Excluding fever, mild \nto moderate toxicities were observed. About one third of patients refused the\nproposed schedule due to general malaise and fatigue.\nCONCLUSIONS: A survival benefit or a favorable outcome of patients with\nmetastatic renal cell carcinoma, treated with IFN-alpha and VBL, could not be\ndemonstrated. As judged from this analysis, IFN-alpha and VBL therapy does not\nsufficiently meet the requirements of a palliative treatment of renal cell\ncarcinoma.\n\nPMID: 7747370  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of 211 patients\nrandomized, 207 were evaluable. There was no improvement in response rates, time \nto response, response duration or overall survival as a result of the loading\ndose. When comparing high and low maintenance doses, there was a significant\ndifference in response rates (48% versus 32%; chi 2 = 10.09, df = 2, P = 0.006)\nand survival (66% versus 41% alive at 12 months; chi 2 = 9.06, df = 1, P = 0.003)\nin favour of the higher dose regimen, although there was no significant\ndifference in the duration of response. There was no additional toxicity\nattributable to the loading dose regimen, but side effects were more frequent\nwith the high dose maintenance schedule (141 of 201 adverse effects occurring in \nthese two groups) although the incidence of severe toxicity was similar with both\nhigh dose and low dose treatments.\n\nPMID: 8845325  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

To avoid possible detection\nbias from Pap smear screening, final analyses were restricted to a subset of\ncases with symptoms at the time of their diagnosis of cervical carcinoma in situ.\nRelative to nonusers, the risk was elevated in women who had ever used DMPA and\nincreased with duration of use. Decreasing trends in relative risk with times\nsince first and last uses were observed in long-term users. Results from another \nportion of this same study did not show a relationship of invasive cervical\ncancer to DMPA use. These findings suggested that if DMPA increases the risk of\ncervical carcinoma in situ then either this is a reversible effect, or the\ncervical lesions induced by DMPA tend not to progress to invasive disease.\n\nPMID: 7750280  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Urological Working Party Renal Carcinoma Subgroup.\n\nFayers PM(1), Cook PA, Machin D, Donaldson N, Whitehead J, Ritchie A, Oliver RT, \nYuen P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)MRC Cancer Trials Office, Cambridge, U.K.\n\nThis paper describes the steps taken by the British Medical Research Council\n(MRC) in developing the MRC RE01 trial, a randomized clinical trial for patients \nwith metastatic renal cancer; we discuss the reasons for adopting a triangular\nsequential design and the impact that this has upon the monitoring of the trial. \nIt had been suggested to the MRC that a trial of biological agents for metastatic\nrenal carcinoma should be initiated. The Cancer Therapy Committee (CTC) of the\nMRC, through its associated site specific working parties, is responsible for\ndesigning and co-ordinating randomized trials of alternative treatments in cancer\nin solid tumours. Since no MRC working party for renal carcinoma existed at that \ntime, development began by the formation of an ad hoc group set up under the\nauspices of the CTC. They assessed, by means of a postal questionnaire, U.K.\ninterest in the trials of, and modalities utilized for, treatment of renal\ncancer. The responses focused attention on the important questions to ask and\nindicated the level of potential collaboration. These responses and related\nclinical and statistical issues suggested a protocol to compare\nmedroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) against alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In view \nof the special problems of comparing an expensive and potentially toxic therapy\nwith an inexpensive and non-toxic standard, a sequential design was used rather\nthan a fixed sample size design. Statistical issues raised and solutions provided\nare described. The method of establishing the trial data monitoring committee and\na brief review of mortality from renal carcinoma in England and Wales are also\nincluded. The trial opened to patient recruitment on 1 January 1992. The formal\nstatements regarding statistical issues that appear in the formal trial protocol \n(RE01) are set out in the Appendix.\n\nPMID: 7846423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Some preliminary\nstudies have shown that progesterone and its analogs may inhibit fibroblast\nproliferation. On the basis of such evidence, we have designed a clinical study\nwith or without the progestational agent medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in\nmetastatic renal cancer patients in maintenance therapy with IL-2 following\nresponse or stable disease (SD) after two cycles of IL-2 subcutaneous\nimmunotherapy, in an attempt to evaluate the influence of MPA on free-from\nprogression (FPP) period.\nMETHODS: The study included 30 consecutive patients who were randomized to\nreceive IL-2 alone (3 million IU twice/day for 5 days/month subcutaneously) or\nIL-2 plus low-dose MPA (500 mg orally one day/week) without interruption until\ndisease progression.\nRESULTS: A FPP period longer than 1 year was obtained in 8/14 patients treated\nwith IL-2 plus MPA and in only 3/16 patients treated with IL-2 alone. The\ndifference was statistically significant. On the contrary, no significant\ndifference was seen in the mean number of lymphocytes and eosinophils, which was \nevaluated monthly. Finally, no hyperglycemic or thromboembolic complications\noccurred in patients concomitantly treated with MPA.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study would suggest that the concomitant\nadministration of low-dose MPA may prolong the FFP period in metastatic renal\ncancer patients under maintenance therapy with IL-2. A longer follow-up will be\nrequired to evaluate the influence of MPA on overall survival.\n\nPMID: 8249176  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thirty patients with unresectable HCC were\nrandomly divided into two groups. A catheter was inserted into the hepatic artery\nof all patients. The first group (group A) was administered 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin\n(CDDP) on day 15 and 13 mg/m2 of Adriamycin (ADM) on day 1 and 8 postoperatively \nvia the hepatic artery cannula; in addition, a daily dose of 150 mg\n5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered orally. Tamoxifen (TAM) 25 mg/m2 daily and\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 400 mg/m2 daily were also administered orally. \nTAM and MPA administration were alternated every 4 weeks. For the second group\n(group B) the same protocol of anticancer drugs administration, without the\nhormonal agents, was given. At least three courses of the treatments were carried\nout. Twelve patients in group A and 14 in group B were evaluated. Partial\nresponse of the hepatic tumor to the treatments was observed in 33.3% of group A \npatients and 21.4% of group B patients, a difference that was not statistically\nsignificant.

CT consisted of\ncisplatin, 60 mg/m2 i.v., along with etoposide (VP-16), 150 mg/m2 i.v., on day 1.\nThe VP-16 was increased to 200 mg/m2, orally, on day 3. The entire regimen was\ngiven every 4 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. MPA was administered in daily\n500-mg doses, i.m., 5 days a week for 1 month, followed by 1000 mg i.m., once a\nweek, for 5 months. Changes in body weight and appetite were documented. After\ntwo cycles of CT, 64 patients were found to be evaluable for response. Forty-five\nhad non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 19 had small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). \nThirty-seven patients had received CT alone and 27 CT plus MPA. In NSCLC, the\nobjective response to CT alone was 36% versus 37% with CT plus MPA. In SCLC, the \ncorresponding figures were 63% and 22%. The overall objective response rate was\n60% in NSCLC and 48% in SCLC. Median survival using CT alone was 10 months for\nNSCLC patients and 11 months for SCLC patients. Using CT plus MPA, it was 10\nmonths for NSCLC patients and 7 months for SCLC patients. In the control arm,\n1-year survival was 42% for NSCLC patients and 48% for SCLC patients; in those\nwho were given MPA, it was 48% for NSCLC patients and 9% for SCLC patients.\nImproved appetite and weight gain were reported more frequently by MPA patients, \nand they did not complain of CT's usual side effects. The fact that MPA had no\nsignificant effect on CT response or survival in patients also treated with a\ncombination of cisplatin and VP-16, along with the small survival advantage for\nthe control group in SCLC patients, suggests that combining MPA and CT may result\nin improved quality of life.\n\nPMID: 2156416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Universit\xc3\xa4ts-Frauenklinik, Wien.\n\nThe dissatisfying results achieved in the therapy of ovarian carcinoma with an\nunchanging low rate (between 10% and 30%) of five-year-survival were the reason\nfor efforts to develop a new treatment scheme combining chemotherapy with hormone\ntherapy for epithelial ovarian carcinoma in FIGO stages III and IV. Basic\ntheoretical and experimental reflections: Although in many cases patients may\nshow good response to standard chemotherapy containing cisplatin, a large\npercentage (70% to 90%) suffers a relapse due to the fact that single tumour\ncells are resistant to chemotherapy. In order to counteract this resistance we\ndeveloped a method of therapy (in accordance with the ideas of Coldman and\nGoldie) based on the sequential application of various non cross-resistant\ncytostatic agents. This new regimen, comprised of Doxorubicin, Cisplatin,\nVincristine, Cyclophosphamide and Methotrexate (AP-VC-MTX), was compared to two\nstandard types of chemotherapy (Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide or\nDoxorubicin/Cisplatin) in a prospective, randomised study. The AP-VC-MTX regimen \nshowed equal therapeutical results but had a significantly lower level of\nnephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity than the combined\nDoxorubicin/Cisplatin therapy. As a result of these studies we chose the\nAP-VC-MTX method as standard therapy for patients suffering from advanced stage\novarian carcinoma. Hormone therapy was tested in numerous phase II studies on\npatients who had previously received cytostatics and was found to be an effective\nalternative. One of the substances that was most closely studied was\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Its therapeutic value was established in in\nvitro tests which showed direct cytotoxicity in ovarian carcinoma and is based on\nthe theory that, on the one hand, the MPA is attached to the progesterone\nreceptor and impairs growth in a similar way to endometrium and breast carcinoma \nand, on the other hand, the MPA reduces the level of gonadotropin and estrogen,\nwhich may be factors, which stimulate tumour growth in ovarian cancer.\nFurthermore, the myeloprotective effect and the corticoid-like effect of the MPA \nusually result in lower bone marrow toxicity and an increase in weight. 81 in\nvitro chemosensitivity tests carried out on tumour-cell cultures of 25 patients\nsuffering from ovarian carcinoma, showed sensitivity to Cisplatin in 38%,\nDoxorubicin in 44%, 4-OOH-Cyclophosphamide (the in vitro active metabolite of\nCyclophosphamide) in 50%, Vincristine in 53%, MTX in 19% and MPA in 36%.(ABSTRACT\nTRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 2145702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Initial treatment was \nwith either diethylstilboestrol (DES) or orchidectomy. Response to DES (5/63,\n81%) was significantly higher than for orchidectomy (18/29, 62%; p less than\n0.01). However, duration of response and duration of survival were not\nsignificantly different for the 2 forms of hormonal therapy. Fifty-seven patients\nwere randomised to receive second-line treatment with either medroxyprogesterone \nacetate (MPA), oral chlorambucil or combination chemotherapy (adriamycin +\ncyclophosphamide + 5-fluoro-uracil). Response to second-line treatment was\nsimilar for all 3 regimens (46% overall response). Most of the responses were\ndisease stabilisation and, although there was symptomatic benefit, response to\nsecond-line therapy did not significantly improve survival compared to the\nsurvival experience of the group as a whole. It is concluded that palliative\nsecond-line treatment for advanced prostatic cancer should consist of the least\ntoxic form of treatment which in this study was second-line hormone\nadministration (MPA).\n\nPMID: 2528705  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Recently, interferon\nalpha (IFN alpha) was used for treatment of this disease in several studies which\nalso demonstrated response rates of 15%. In order to test whether IFN therapy\ncombined with hormones would result in higher response rates we compared single\nagent IFN therapy with a combined therapy of rIFN alpha 2C plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in a randomized multicenter trial. The rIFN\nalpha 2C (2MU) was given s.c. 5 times per week for 8-12 weeks and subsequently\nonce weekly until week 48. In the combined treatment, 750 mg MPA was given p.o.\ndaily until week 48 in addition to the IFN as described. The overall response\nrate in 93 evaluable patients was 5.4% corresponding to 2 complete and 3 partial \nresponses. Median survival was 7 months in both treatment groups. These data\nconfirm the ineffectivity of low IFN doses for treatment of RCC. The low response\nrate is not increased by addition of MPA to IFN. The analysis of other IFN\nstudies suggests that not only IFN doses but also IFN sources may influence\nresponse rates in metastatic RCC.\n\nPMID: 2965154  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In randomized clinical trials involving postmenopausal patients,\ntamoxifen has been found to be as effective as high-dose estrogens, androgens,\nprogestins, and the aromatase inhibitor, aminoglutethimide. Because of its\nremarkable lack of significant toxicity, tamoxifen is now considered the first\nendocrine treatment of choice of hormone-responsive postmenopausal breast cancer.\nAlthough effective in a significant fraction of premenopausal patients, tamoxifen\ncannot be considered a substitute for ovariectomy because it usually does not\nsuppress menses and because response to castration may occur after progression\nduring antiestrogen therapy. Current evidence suggests that there is no major\nadvantage in combining tamoxifen with other endocrine therapies or chemotherapy. \nAt present, it appears preferable to use different modalities of endocrine\ntherapy sequentially in those patients with hormone-responsive cancers.\nChemotherapy should be delayed until maximum benefit has been obtained from\nendocrine therapy.\n\nPMID: 2950193  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, multicenter trials require strong efforts for quality\nassurance concerning admission, treatment and follow-up, thus a highly developed \ncoordinating center is needed.

All 25 patients were followed until time of death and all were able\nto receive hormonal therapy. We did not find substantially improved response\nrates when combination chemotherapy was applied before endocrine treatment since \nthe 33% objective response rate to chemotherapy was only minimally higher than\nthe response in our patients who had failed hormonal therapy and then received\nidentical or similar chemotherapy. Furthermore, the introduction of intensive\ncombination chemotherapy before hormonal therapy in our study did not result in\nany striking improvement in overall survival compared with patients who received \ninitial hormonal therapy in many other studies. Responses to chemotherapy were\nnot attributable to suppression of serum testosterone since all 12 patients with \npartial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) and four of seven patients with no\nresponse (NR) had normal testosterone levels at the time of response assessment. \nThe initial use of chemotherapy did not adversely affect the expected high\npercentage of objective responses (68%) to subsequent hormonal manipulation. The \nfrequency, duration, and quality of responses to hormonal therapy exceeded the\nresponses to chemotherapy. The disappointing responses to chemotherapy reflect\nthe very modest efficacy of even aggressively delivered cytotoxic agents.\n\nPMID: 2943877  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Furthermore, MPA has been evaluated in tumors which are not classically\nconsidered hormone-related, such as ovarian cancer. Therapy with one of a number \nof progestational agents has been the conventional approach to the management of \nendometrial carcinoma not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy. Among the\nvarious synthetic progestins, MPA has been the most widely employed both by i.m. \nand oral routes, according to a variety of doses and schedules. Objective\nresponses have been obtained in a percentage of women varying between 30 and 50% \nin the different series. While the role of MPA in the palliative treatment of\nadvanced disease is well accepted, opinion is divided on the role of progestins\nin the adjuvant setting. On the basis of available data, it should be concluded\nthat the usefulness of adjuvant therapy with progestins in high risk, early-stage\nendometrial cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated. As far as prostatic\ncancer is concerned, data coming from comparative trials show that MPA is less\neffective than diethylstilbestrol (DES), and therefore should not be considered\nthe first choice for previously untreated patients. However, it can achieve\nresponses in patients who no longer respond or who are refractory to DES, and\nrepresents the treatment of choice for those patients who, due to their\ncardiovascular conditions, cannot be given estrogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250\nWORDS)\n\nPMID: 2941173  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of the original 21 non-responders to MPA\nalone, 10 responded to the combination (47.6%) and 11 (52.4%) did not; the\ncomparable figures for the TAM alone group were 13 (61.9%) and 8 (38.1%),\nrespectively. Survival rates were much higher in the differentiated than in the\nundifferentiated carcinomas. In conclusion, we feel that the efficacy, and the\nfew side-effects of these drugs used alone and particularly when used in\nsequential combination, make them a very attractive treatment for advanced\nendometrial adenocarcinoma.\n\nPMID: 6235140  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After the first year of follow-up, the\nrelapse rate was 13% in the controls (5 of 38 evaluable patients) versus 28% in\nthe MPA treatment group (9 of 32). Sex steroid receptors were studied in both the\ntumor and in the surrounding healthy parenchyma by the dextran-coated charcoal\ntechnique in 52 of 70 clinically evaluable patients. There was no significant\ncorrelation between receptor studies and the relapse rate. Besides, receptors\nwere more often detected in the healthy than in the neoplastic tissue, and values\nrarely exceeded 10 fmol/mg protein. Due to the negative trend in the MPA\ntreatment group, the admittance of patients to this study was stopped after 120\npatients had been accepted.\n\nPMID: 6223819  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Prospective SAKK-study 20/71].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nSenn HJ, Lei D, Casta\xc3\xb1o-Almendral A, Brunner KW, Martz G, Obrecht P, Melchert F, \nRhomberg W.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1974 89 patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO-stage III-IV),\nadmitted to seven centers of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK),\nwere randomly allocated to three different treatment schedules: cyclophosphamide \n(CYT) alone or CYT in combination with either medroxyprogesterone acetate (GEST) \nor 5-fluorouracil (FU). Results in 71 evaluable patients (according to\nstandardized group criterial) were as follows: 1. The overall remission rate was \n48% (34 out of 71 patients) with no clear-cut statistical difference between the \nthree treatment schedules but a firm trend towards higher remission rate with CYT\n+ FU (58% as compared to 42% with CYT alone). 2. The scheduled "second-look"\noperations were performed in only 5 of 34 patients clinically judged to respond\nto therapy (PR), and does not allow objective surgical monitoring of therapeutic \neffects intraabdominally. 3. The median remission duration varied from 3 months\n(CYT alone) to 6 months (CYT + FU or CYT + GEST), again with only marginal\nstatistical differences. 4. With regard to survival from initiation of\nchemotherapy, no treatment regimen was superior to another. The median survival\nranged from 6.6 months (CYT) to 10.3 months (CYT + GEST). Patients responding to \nchemo-(hormone) therapy (CR + PR + NC) showed a significant prolongation of\nsurvival as compared to those with initial disease progression: median survival\nin "responders" was 11 months and in "non-responders" 2.9 months. A small group\nof 8-10% of all treated patients has survived in documented tumor remission for 4\nyears and more. 5. Toxicity was moderate and consisted mainly of mild temporary\nhematologic depression, tolerable nausea and transient alopecia, with equal\ndistribution in the three treatment regimens. Hemorrhagic cystitis due to CYT was\nobserved only in 3 cases. 6. Progress in remission induction and duration, as\nwell as survival in advanced ovarian cancer, seems to depend on the inclusion of \nnew effective agents (such as adriamycin, hexamethylmelamine and cisplatinum)\nand, most probably, on significantly more intensive treatment.\n\nPMID: 7423163  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

One hundred fourteen\npatients were included in the study: 70 received Delalutin and 44 Depo-Provera.\nThere was no significant increase in the objective response or survival between\nthe Delalutin or Depo-Provera patients. Of the 114 patients, 15.8% achieved an\nobjective response, with 7.0% being complete responders. There was no significant\nincrease in objective response to Delalutin or Depo-Provera in relationship to\nthe size of the tumor masses, the number of metastases, site of metastases,\nhistologic grade of the primary, histologic grade of recurrence or metastases, or\nprior radiation therapy. The only significant correlate was that patients whose\ndisease recurred 3 or more years after the initial therapy had a significant (P =\n0.01) increase in response (33.3%) compared to those with recurrence less than 3 \nyears after their original treatment (8.3%).\n\nPMID: 6985833  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1979 Nov 1;135(5):647-50.\n\nA comparison of medroxyprogesterone serum concentrations by the oral or\nintramuscular route in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial\ncarcinoma.\n\nSall S, DiSaia P, Morrow CP, Mortel R, Prem K, Thigpen T, Creasman W.\n\nA randomized study, comparing serum medroxyprogesterone concentrations by the\noral and intramuscular routes, was performed on 22 patients with persistent or\nrecurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma by six institutions of the Gynecologic\nOncology Group. The oral group (11 patients) received cutaneous Provera\n(medroxyprogesterone), 50 mg three times a day, and the intramuscular group (11\npatients) received 300 mg of Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone) weekly for at\nleast 2 months. Serum levels were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours\nafter administration and every day for the first week and weekly thereafter for 8\nweeks. The mean serum levels (nanograms per milliliter) of medroxyprogesterone in\nthe oral group were consistently higher than the corresponding mean levels of the\nintramuscular group. In addition, from the first through eighth weeks, the\nmeasurements (medians) for the oral group were statistically higher than those\nfor the intramuscular group. Although the study indicates a significant increase \nin serum levels achieved by the oral route, the follow-up period of patients\nunder study is too early to evaluate its clinical effectiveness as compared to\nthe intramuscular route.\n\nPIP: 22 patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma being\nseen by the 6 institutions of the Gynecologic Oncology Group were studied in a\nrandomized way to compare serum levels of medroxyprogesterone after oral and\nintramuscular administration. Regimen A, the oral group, consisted of 11 patients\nwho received cutaneous Provera in 50-mg doses 3 times per day; the intramuscular \ngroup, Regimen B, consisted of the other 11 subjects who received 300-mg doses of\nDepo-Provera weekly for at least 2 months. 3 ml of blood was drawn for both\nregimen groups at 0,2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after administration on Day 1, daily\nthereafter for the 1st week, and weekly thereafter for the course of the study.\nMean serum levels of medroxyprogesterone, measured by radioimmoassay in ng/ml,\nwere consistently higher in the oral group than the corresponding mean levels in \nthe intramuscular group. Also, from Weeks 1-8, the medians for the oral group\nwere statistically higher than those for Regimen B. The apparent efficacy of the \noral route is indicated, but its clinical effectiveness remains untested, for\nthis study has limited follow-up time.\nPMID: 507117  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A low order or response was observed, and these agents\nwere not proven effective as treatment for metastatic renal cell cancer.\nPerformance status and a relatively long symptom-free interval from primary tumor\nto metastatic disease were found to be the most prognostically significant\nfactors for survival.\n\nPIP: Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer have an overall 5-year survival\nrate of only 28% to 40% in spite of aggressive surgical treatment. A prospective \nrandomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group used\nmethyl--CCNU (meCCNU), vinblastine, and meCCNU-medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) \nto treat 165 patients with advanced renal cancer. The antitumor activity of the\nsingle-agent and/or combination therapy is analyzed. Patients were classified (as\nto grade of anaplasia of tumor; age; performance status; primary site of\nmetastatic disease; and previous treatment with a progestational agent) and\nrandomly assigned to various treatment protocols as described. Crossover\nrandomization to one of alternate single-agent or combination regimens was\ncarried out after failure with initial therapy. 2 meCCNU regimens were associated\nwith severe hematologic toxicity, vinblastine regimens with neurotoxicity. All\nregimens except the vinblastine-MPA resulted in substantial vomiting. Response\nrate is low (11%) with each regimen. There were no statistically significant\ndifferences in treatment variables or factors among the various regimens.\nPatients capable of normal activity had a significantly higher response rate and \nlonger survival period than nonambulatory or poor performance status patients. A \nrelatively long symptom-free interval from primary tumor to metastatic disease\nwas also associated with better survival rate. More than 50% of patients\nexhibited disease progression with 3 months of initiating the regimens.\nPMID: 356971  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Positive results were obtained in 20.8%\nof the cases in the 1st group and in 41.5% of the cases in the 2nd, which shows\nthe greater effectiveness of the larger doses. Side effects mainly included\nasthma, skin rashes, and jaundice symptoms, which could be treated; it was always\npossible to continue the MPA treatment. Results appeared to be better in the case\nof patients with a localized disease, while the age of the patient appeared to be\nunrelated to the effectiveness of treatment.

To evaluate the effects of HRT on those factors in\nend-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, we evaluated the changes of lipid\nprofile, coagulation and fibrinolysis markers, and plasma homocysteine levels\nafter treatment.\nMETHODS: Sixty-five post-menopausal women on maintenance haemodialysis were\nrandomly assigned to either an HRT group (n=33) or a control group (n=32). Median\nage (range) and duration of haemodialysis (range) were 57 years (40-73) and 42\nmonths (6-150) in the HRT group and 61 years (44-78) and 54 months (8-174) in the\ncontrol group respectively. Oral conjugated oestrogen (0.625 mg) combined with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) was given daily for 12 weeks to the HRT\ngroup. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),\ntriglycerides (TG), lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), fibrinogen, plasminogen activator\ntype 1 antigen (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen antigen (t-PA), von Willebrand factor \n(vWF), and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) were measured before and 12 weeks\nafter the start of the study in both groups.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in baseline values between the control and HRT\ngroups. At 12 weeks, HRT increased HDL-C by 12% (P:<0.01) and TG by 20% (P:<0.\n01). HRT decreased LDL-C by 9% (P:<0.01), and Lp(a) by 36% (P:<0.01). PAI-1 and\nt-PA concentrations were also reduced by 21% (P:<0.01) and 9% (P:<0.05)\nrespectively. The mean values of TC, fibrinogen, vWF, and tHcy levels did not\nchange significantly after HRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The above results suggest that HRT has favourable effects on\natherosclerosis risk parameters in post-menopausal women with ESRD as in the\ngeneral population of post-menopausal women.\n\nPMID: 11071974  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thirty-three chemotherapy-naive\npatients with NSCLC were enrolled in the study and 30 of them were evaluable. The\nmean age of the patients was 61 years. Twenty (66.7%) out of 30 patients were\n>or=60 years, and 5 (16.7%) patients were >or=70 years. The ECOG performance\nstatus was 0 to 1 in 30 patients and 2 in 3 patients. Twenty-six patients (78.8%)\nhad stage IIIB disease and 7 (21.2%) had stage IV; histology was mainly squamous \ncell carcinoma (72.7%). The treatment consisted of cisplatin 40 mg/m2/week and\nepirubicin 40 mg/m2/week both intravenously on day 1, rIL-2 1.8 MIU/day\nsubcutaneously, MPA 1 g/day orally, alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg/day orally and\nN-acetyl cysteine 1.8 g/day orally. The treatment was administered for 6 weeks.\nPatients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease\n(SD) continued the treatment, according to response re-evaluation, until 15\nweeks. The present study reports the results of 6, 9, 12 and 15-week treatment.\nAfter 6 weeks, 30 patients were assessable for response: no CR was observed, a PR\nwas achieved in 15 patients (50%; ORR 50%). After 15 weeks, 1 CR and 8 PR were\nobserved (ORR 30.0%). The median follow-up period was 13 months. The median\nduration of response was 9 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 15\nmonths. The one-year survival rate was 55.8%. The median progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) was 10 months. The toxicity was, as expected, mainly hematologic: \nneutropenia was the most significant symptom. The non-hematologic toxicity was\nquite low. Therefore, the treatment's toxicity was quite acceptable. There was no\ntoxic death. The 30.0% ORR, the 15 month OS and the 10 month PFS obtained in this\nstudy are comparable with those observed with cisplatin plus epirubicin (ORR\n39-54%) in phase II studies and in a previous phase III study (ORR 33%, OS 10.5\nmonths). Moreover, the toxicity was acceptable and it was mainly hematologic.\nSerum levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly decreased after\ntreatment.\n\nPMID: 11956647  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Appetite (0 to 10 numerical\nrating scale), weight, and QL (European Organization for Research and Treatment\nof Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC-QLQ-C30]) were assessed before the\nstart of treatment (t = 0), and 6 weeks (t = 6) and 12 weeks (t = 12) thereafter.\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients (68 MPA and 66 placebo) were assessable\nat t = 6 and 99 patients (53 MPA and 46 placebo) at t = 12. A beneficial effect\nof MPA on appetite was observed after both 6 weeks (P = .008) and 12 weeks (P =\n.01) of treatment. After 12 weeks, a mean weight gain of 0.6 +/- 4.4 kg was seen \nin the MPA, versus an ongoing mean weight loss of 1.4 +/- 4.6 kg in the placebo\ngroup. This difference of 2.0 kg was statistically significant (P = .04). During \nthe study, several areas of QL deteriorated in the total group of patients. With \nthe exception of an improvement in appetite and possible also a reduction in\nnausea and vomiting, no measurable beneficial effects of MPA on QL could be\ndemonstrated. The side effects profile of MPA was favorable: only a trend toward \nan increase in (usually mild) peripheral edema was observed.\nCONCLUSION: In weight-losing, advanced-stage non-hormone-sensitive cancer\npatients, MPA exhibits a mild side effects profile, has a beneficial effect on\nappetite, and may prevent further weight loss. However, general QL in the present\nstudy was not measurably influenced by MPA treatment.\n\nPMID: 8648360  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were randomly divieded into\nthree groups, they received Furlutal in the 1st (group A), 2nd (group B) and\nevery cycle in (group C), respectively. The results show that Furlutal is\neffective in preventing anorexia, weight loss and myelosuppression. In group A,\n85% patients gained weight, averaged 2.5kg (range: 1-7kg); 80% in group B,\naverged 2.25kg (1-7kg) and 95% in group C, averaged 4kg (2.5-8kg). Grade III\nmyelosuppression, according to WHO criteria, 52.5% occurred in of patients\ntreated with 80 cycles of chemotherapy only while it occurred in 19% in those\ntreated with 100 cycles of chemotherapy plus Furlutal (P < 0.01).\n\nPMID: 7587896  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

CT consisted of\ncisplatin, 60 mg/m2 i.v., along with etoposide (VP-16), 150 mg/m2 i.v., on day 1.\nThe VP-16 was increased to 200 mg/m2, orally, on day 3. The entire regimen was\ngiven every 4 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. MPA was administered in daily\n500-mg doses, i.m., 5 days a week for 1 month, followed by 1000 mg i.m., once a\nweek, for 5 months. Changes in body weight and appetite were documented. After\ntwo cycles of CT, 64 patients were found to be evaluable for response. Forty-five\nhad non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 19 had small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). \nThirty-seven patients had received CT alone and 27 CT plus MPA. In NSCLC, the\nobjective response to CT alone was 36% versus 37% with CT plus MPA. In SCLC, the \ncorresponding figures were 63% and 22%. The overall objective response rate was\n60% in NSCLC and 48% in SCLC. Median survival using CT alone was 10 months for\nNSCLC patients and 11 months for SCLC patients. Using CT plus MPA, it was 10\nmonths for NSCLC patients and 7 months for SCLC patients. In the control arm,\n1-year survival was 42% for NSCLC patients and 48% for SCLC patients; in those\nwho were given MPA, it was 48% for NSCLC patients and 9% for SCLC patients.\nImproved appetite and weight gain were reported more frequently by MPA patients, \nand they did not complain of CT's usual side effects. The fact that MPA had no\nsignificant effect on CT response or survival in patients also treated with a\ncombination of cisplatin and VP-16, along with the small survival advantage for\nthe control group in SCLC patients, suggests that combining MPA and CT may result\nin improved quality of life.\n\nPMID: 2156416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Tumori. 1979 Oct 31;65(5):563-85.\n\nHigh-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment in advanced breast cancer. \nA review.\n\nGanzina F.\n\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) when employed at high doses (greater than or\nequal to 500 greater than or equal to 1000 mg/day i.m.) can produce objective\nremission with improved survival in about 30% of postmenopausal women with\nadvanced breast cancer resistant to cytotoxic drugs and endocrine therapies. When\nadministered to women not previously treated with chemotherapy, the objective\nremission response rate reached 40%. From available evidence, high dose MPA can\nbe considered a useful agent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in\npostmenopausal women with soft tissue, pulmonary, pleural or osseous involvement \neven when patients have become refractory to prior hormone and cytotoxic\ntherapies. Early results suggest that the response rate can be increased in\npatients with estrogen and/or progesterone-positive receptors. It is note worthy \nthat in a study conducted on postmenopausal women resistant to cytotoxic and/or\nhormonal drugs, the median duration of survival was 13.5 months, while CRs plus\nPRs did not reach the median at 24 months after starting MPA treatment. High dose\nMPA is essentially devoid of major side effects. Relief of pain, increase in\nappetite and body weight, and sense of well being are characteristic features of \nthe improved quality of life under MPA treatment. However, a gluteal abscess\n(from 2% to 20% dose related) is the most frequent side effect. A promising area \nfor future studies is combined therapy using hormonal and cytotoxic agents or\nalternating sequential combinations. Well-designed studies are needed to develop \nmeans for increasing the complete response rate and therefore survival. Recent\nstudies of combined chemo- and hormonal (MPA) therapy have yielded objective\ntumor regressions of 53 to 80% with an increased rate of complete remissions and \nduration of response.\n\nPIP: (MPA) Medroxyprogesterone acetate when employed at high doses (5001000\nmg/day intramuscularly) can produce objective remission with improved survival in\nabout 30% of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer resistant to\ncytotoxic drugs and endocrine therapies. When administered to women not\npreviously treated with chemotherapy, the objective remission response rate\nreached 40%. From available evidence, high dose MPA can be considered a useful\nagent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with\nsoft tissue, pulmonary, pleural, or osseous involvement even when patients have\nbecome refractory to prior hormone and cytotoxic therapies.

There\nwere no objective responders among the eight patients treated with recombinant\ngamma-interferon at an i.v. dose of 1 mg/m(2) daily for five days every other\nweek for four weeks then 1 mg/m(2) three times a week given every other week\nuntil there was documented disease progression or complete response (CR). Overall\nmedian survival was 17.3 months (range 1.4 to 184). The major side effects of\ntreatment included fever/chills (75%), mild anorexia and fatigue (75%),\nnausea/vomiting (80%), leukopenia (38%), and abnormal liver function tests (25%).\nThere were no life-threatening side effects observed. At our institution, in a\nrandom cohort of eight patients with metastatic RCC, recombinant gamma-interferon\nwhen given at a dose of 1 mg/m(2) per day given three times per week on an every \nother week schedule yields no clinical antitumor activity. A review of the\nliterature on the use of gamma-interferon for metastatic RCC suggests that\nlow-dose combination therapy with other cytokines may yield the best\nresponse-to-side effect ratio. Higher doses yield more responses but an added\ncost of more toxicity.\n\nPMID: 8610639  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Women with prior hysterectomy received CEE alone (0.625 mg/d)\n(n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895310) or placebo (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895429). The intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years\nin CEE plus MPA trial and 7.2 years in CEE alone trial with 13 years of\ncumulative follow-up until September 30, 2010.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were coronary\nheart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer, respectively. A global index also\nincluded stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip\nfracture, and death.\nRESULTS: During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases\nwere 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI,\n0.95-1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24;\n95% CI, 1.01-1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism,\ndementia (in women aged \xe2\x89\xa565 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary\nincontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor \nsymptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some\nelevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases \nfor CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11-1.48]). The risks and\nbenefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases \nfor CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14) and 104 vs\n135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02);\ncumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer\ndiagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar \nto CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone,\nyounger women (aged 50-59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause\nmortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89.05 for trend\nby age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per\n10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of\n50-59 years to 38 for ages of 70-79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19\nfewer cases for ages of 50-59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70-79 years.\nQuality-of-life outcomes had mixed results in both trials.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Menopausal hormone therapy has a complex pattern of\nrisks and benefits. Findings from the intervention and extended postintervention \nfollow-up of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trials do not support use of this therapy \nfor chronic disease prevention, although it is appropriate for symptom management\nin some women.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMCID: PMC3963523 [Available on 2014/10/2]\nPMID: 24084921  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We examined adolescents' interest in and proficiency at\nDMPA-SC self-administration.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This is a planned secondary analysis of a randomized controlled\ntrial comparing pain between DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC. In the trial, study\nparticipants (N=55) aged 14-21 years were recruited at DMPA initiation and\nrandomized to receive DMPA-IM or DMPA-SC. Participants received the alternate\nformulation at 3 months, chose formulation at 6 months and could learn\nself-administration at 9 months. The current analysis is of the women who chose\nself-administration of DMPA-SC. Proficiency was rated for each step of\nself-administration: independently [I], with reassurance [R], with verbal\ninstruction [V] or nurse performed [RN]. Data were analyzed using descriptive and\ncomparative statistics.\nRESULTS: Thirty-five percent (19/55) of participants learned self-administration.\nProficiency ratings were as follows: chose injection site (I=78.9%, R=5.3%,\nV=5.3%, RN=10.5%), cleaned site (I=89.5%, RN=10.5%), assembled injection device\n(I=47.4%, R=36.8%, V=15.8%), self-injected (I=31.6%, R=36.8%, V=15.8%, RN=15.8%) \nand disposed of device (I=21.1%, R=21.1%, RN=57.9%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents are interested in and capable of DMPA-SC\nself-administration with brief education and minimal assistance.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The patients were divided\nrandomly into two groups. First group including 22 women receive ten mg MPA, for \nten days during a month for three months. All cases were followed by interview,\nendometrial curetage, and vaginal sonography. Serum level of estradiol was\nchecked before and after treatment. At the end of the study, biopsy was retaken\nin 41 patients. All the patients were under observation by two gynecologists.\nRESULTS: Age range of patients was 20 to 42 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) in \nthe MPA and letrozole groups was 29.13 +/- 4.8 and 25.42 +/- 4.2, respectively.\nFifty and 34.8 percent of cases had history of obesity or polycystic ovarian\nsyndrome (PCOS) in MPA and letrozole groups, respectively. Forty-one selected\ncases (20 of the MPA and 21 of the letrozole groups) continued the treatment for \nthree months. The endometrial thicknesses decreased in both groups. Serum\nestradiol level also decreased in both groups. The most common complication in\nthe MPA and letrozole groups was headache (27.3%) and flashing and dizziness,\nrespectively. The side-effects were reported less in the letrozole group and the \nmost common ones in this group were dizziness and flashing.\nDISCUSSION: In women suffering from simple endometrial hyperplasia without\natypia, letrozole can lead to decrease of serum estradiol level and endometrial\nthickness like MPA. In both groups, there was no simple hyperplasia report in\ncurettage report following treatment. It should be noted that there was an\nincomplete response to treat case with pathology of disordered proliferative\ntype.\nCONCLUSION: Letrozole is a good therapeutic option in simple endometrial\nhyperplasia without atypia: cases candidate for medical treatment. To confirm the\neffect and safety of letrozole, more studies with larger samples are recommended.\n\nPMID: 24601050  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However,\nevidence has emerged indicating a phasic rather than linear progression with\ntime. A major reason for this non-linear pattern appears to be the occurrence of \nhemorrhages in the arterial wall, although data on this issue are still scarce.\nWe studied the occurrence of temporarily impressive thickenings of the carotid\narterial wall in a cohort of healthy postmenopausal women who were followed up\nfor 3 years with regular carotid ultrasound examinations.\nMETHODS: The women were the European participants of a randomized\nplacebo-controlled trial into the effect of hormone replacement therapy on\nprogression of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). For a period of 3 years,\nthe women underwent a standardized carotid ultrasound protocol every 6 months.\nCommon, bifurcation and internal carotid segments were scanned on both sides,\nstored on videotape, and the near and far wall CIMT was measured on defined\nangles and segments, also in areas of plaque. Adverse events were routinely\nrecorded. At the completion of the study, all segment-specific measurements were \nevaluated for outliers. Images were retrieved from videotape and evaluated\nwhether the outlier resulted from a real morphological change or 'measurement\nerror'.\nRESULTS: The 509 healthy postmenopausal women, free from previous symptomatic\ncardiovascular disease, underwent 3,812 carotid ultrasound scans during the\nstudy, and 44,924 carotid segments were evaluated. In 203 segments of 188\nparticipants outliers were observed. True morphological changes were found in 12 \nparticipants, equivalent to a 3-year risk of 2.4%. These changes did not give\nrise to clinical symptoms. In the 6 women of whom we had follow-up measurements, \nthe changes were reversed within 6-12 months.\nCONCLUSION: We observed acute increases in CIMT among 2.4% of healthy\npostmenopausal European women followed for 3 years. When assuming these were the \nresult of vessel wall hemorrhages, our findings add to the body of evidence\nsuggesting that vessel wall hemorrhages contribute to atherosclerosis development\nand also appear to occur clinically silent.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 S.

The strongest statistical evidence was for global\ncognitive function (0.07-standard deviation decrements during (P=.007) and after \n(P=.01) the trial. For domain-specific scores, the mean decrements were slightly \nsmaller, were less significant, and tended to be larger for CEE-alone therapy.\nCONCLUSION: CEE-based therapies, when initiated after the age of 65, produce a\nsmall broad-based decrement in cognitive function that persists after their use\nis stopped, but the differences in cognitive function are small and would not be \ndetectable or have clinical significance for an individual woman. Differences in \neffects between cognitive domains suggest that more than one mechanism may be\ninvolved.\n\nPMCID: PMC2917208\nPMID: 20649689  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Serum estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),\nbone gla protein levels, visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, bone mineral\ndensity of lumbar spine, vaginal exfoliate cell spurs and the form of Kupperman\nwere compared in patients before and after treatment.\nRESULTS: (1) After treatment, the level of FSH and E2 levels were (5.0 +/- 2.6)\nU/L and (29 +/- 17) pmol/L in group A and (3.0 +/- 1.5) U/L, and (87 +/- 53)\npmol/L in group B, which were significantly lower than those before treatment\n[FSH (17.0 +/- 12.2) U/L, and E2 (184 +/- 194) pmol/L in group A and FSH: (15.3\n+/- 13.6) U/L and E2: (281 +/- 242) pmol/L in group B, P < 0.01]. On the seventh \nday after three-month GnRH-a treatment, it was observed that the level of E2 was \nhigher and FSH was lower in group B than the level of E2 and FSH of group A (P < \n0.01). (2) After treatment, the basal vaginal exfoliate cell proportion in group \nA [(66.2 +/- 29.0)%] was significantly lower than that in group B [(11.8 +/-\n28.0)%, P < 0.01]; while patients in group A owned a lower proportion of the\nmiddle [(29.1 +/- 23.1)%], superficial layers [(4.0 +/- 5.5)%] and esinophilic\ncells [(2.3 +/- 2.6)%] than patients group B [middle layer: (73.0 +/- 25.2)%;\nsuperficial layer: (15.2 +/- 10.9)%; esinophilic cells: (10.8 +/- 7.9)%; P <\n0.01. (3) Before the treatment, patients'VAS scores of total, pelvic pain,\ndysmenorrheal and dyspareunia were 7.43 +/- 3.20, 2.35 +/- 1.82, 4.93 +/- 1.98\nand 0.14 +/- 0.53 in group A and were 7.71 +/- 2.02, 2.57 +/- 1.60, 4.86 +/- 1.56\nand 0.29 +/- 1.07 in group B; after treatment, the scores above were changed to\n0. 14 +/- 0.36, 0.07 +/- 0.27, 0.07 +/- 0.27 and 0 in group A and 0.36 +/- 0.50, \n0.29 +/- 0.47, 0.07 +/- 0.27 and 0 in group B, which were all significantly lower\nthan those before treatment separately (P < 0.01). When menstruation recovered,\nthe scores were 0.21 +/- 0.43, 0.07 +/- 0.27, 0.14 +/- 0.36, and 0 in group A and\n0.50 +/- 0.65, 0.29 +/- 0.47, 0.21 +/- 0.43 and 0 in group B, which were also\nsignificantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.01), however, no\nstatistical difference was found between groups at any time spot (P > 0.05). (4) \nIn group A, the bone density after treatment [(0.96 +/- 0.06) g/cm2] was lower\nthan that before treatment [(0.99 +/- 0.06) g/cm2, P < 0.01)]. In group B, the\nindex was (0.98 +/- 0.09) g/cm2, which was lower than that before treatment\n[(0.99 +/- 0.10) g/cm2, P = 0. 201]. No statistical difference was found between \ngroups (P > 0.05). The bone loss rate were (-2.77 +/- 1.97)% in group A and\n(-0.93 +/- 2.86)% in group B (P = 0.058). Before treatment, the bone gla protein \nwas (13 +/- 3) microg/L in group A and (13 +/- 6) microg/L in group B.

Whether breast tenderness during estrogen plus progestin\ntherapy is associated with breast cancer risk is uncertain.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen + Progestin\nTrial, which randomized postmenopausal women with an intact uterus to receive\ndaily conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate,\n2.5 mg (n = 8506), or placebo (n = 8102). At baseline and annually, participants \nunderwent mammography and clinical breast examination. Self-reported breast\ntenderness was assessed at baseline and at 12 months. The incidence of invasive\nbreast cancer was confirmed by medical record review (mean follow-up of 5.6\nyears).\nRESULTS: Of women without baseline breast tenderness (n = 14,538), significantly \nmore assigned to receive conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone vs \nplacebo experienced new-onset breast tenderness after 12 months (36.1% vs 11.8%, \nP < .001). Of women in the conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone\ngroup, breast cancer risk was significantly higher in those with new-onset breast\ntenderness compared with those without (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence\ninterval, 1.08-2.03; P = .02). In the placebo group, breast cancer risk was not\nsignificantly associated with new-onset breast tenderness (P = .97).\nCONCLUSIONS: New-onset breast tenderness during conjugated equine estrogens plus \nmedroxyprogesterone therapy was associated with increased breast cancer risk. The\nsensitivity and specificity of the association between breast tenderness and\nbreast cancer were similar in magnitude to those of the Gail model.

Women included in this report were aged 65-80\nyears and free of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) when originally\nenrolled in the trials, which lasted an average of 4-6 years and were conducted\nat 14 academic U.S. medical centers. The associations that regional brain volumes\nand ischemic lesion volumes had with the development of cognitive impairment\n(i.e., dementia or MCI) were contrasted between treatment groups using analyses\nof covariance.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three women developed MCI or probable dementia during follow-up.\nAmong women who had been prescribed CEE-based therapies, cognitive impairment was\nassociated with relatively smaller hippocampal (p = .0002) and total brain\nvolumes (p = .03). Qualitatively, these associations appeared to be independent\nof their level of pretreatment cognitive function. Among women who had been\nprescribed placebo, these relationships were not evident; instead, cognitive\nimpairment was associated with greater ischemic lesion volume in the frontal lobe\n(p = .007) and overall (p = .02).\nCONCLUSION: A mechanism by which CEE-based postmenopausal hormone therapy induces\ncognitive impairment appears to be through increased brain atrophy.\n\nPMCID: PMC2773813\nPMID: 19729392  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Hazard ratios for breast cancer and\ntotal cancer were comparatively higher (P < 0.05) among women who initiated\nhormone therapy soon after menopause, for both regimens. Among these women, use\nof conjugated equine estrogens appeared to produce elevations in venous\nthromboembolism and stroke and a reduction in hip fracture.

Outcome measures included memory, subjective cognition, QoL,\nsexuality, and sleep, which were assessed at baseline and month 4.\nRESULTS: The study was terminated before the expected final sample size of 275\ndue to a decrease in enrollment coinciding with the publication of findings from \nthe Women's Health Initiative. There were no differences between groups on any\ncognitive or QoL measures, except for an increase in sexual interest and thoughts\nwith HT. Modest negative effects on short- and long-term verbal memory approached\nsignificance (p < 0.10). Women with baseline vasomotor symptoms (VMS) showed a\ndecrease in VMS and an improvement in general QoL, but no cognitive benefit vs\nplacebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the power to detect an effect size of >or=0.45, this study\nsuggests potential modest negative effects on verbal memory that are consistent\nwith previous hormone therapy trials in older women.\n\nPMID: 17893293  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Tibolone was compared with continuous combined\nconjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (0.625 + \n2.5 mg/d).\nMETHODS: Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to tibolone 1.25 mg/d, 2.5\nmg/d, and CEE/MPA, respectively. The one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) has\nbeen evaluated for the incidence of abnormal endometrial histology (hyperplasia\nor carcinoma) and hyperplasia and carcinoma separately for each of the two\ntreatment groups and the treatment groups combined after 1 and 2 yr of treatment \nwith tibolone, compared with CEE/MPA.\nRESULTS: A total of 3240 women were randomized, with 3224 receiving at least one \ndose of study medication. The incidence and upper one-sided 95% CI for the\nincidence of abnormal endometrium (hyperplasia or carcinoma), and hyperplasia and\ncarcinoma separately, were calculated at end point, yr 1, and yr 2. The incidence\n(upper one-sided 95% CI) of abnormal endometrium at end point was 0.0 (0.5), 0.0 \n(0.4), and 0.2 (0.5) in the tibolone 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and CEE/MPA groups,\nrespectively. During the entire treatment period, amenorrhea was reported more\nfrequently with tibolone 1.25 mg (78.7%) and 2.5 mg (71.4%) than CEE/MPA (44.9%).\nCONCLUSION: The Tibolone Histology of the Endometrium and Breast Endpoints Study \nresults confirm previous findings that tibolone does not induce endometrial\nhyperplasia or carcinoma in postmenopausal women, and it is associated with a\nbetter vaginal bleeding profile than CEE/MPA.\n\nPMID: 17192288  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epilepsia. 2006 Sep;47(9):1447-51.\n\nHormone replacement therapy in women with epilepsy: a randomized, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled study.\n\nHarden CL(1), Herzog AG, Nikolov BG, Koppel BS, Christos PJ, Fowler K, Labar DR, \nHauser WA.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, Weill\nMedical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.\nclharden@med.cornell.edu\n\nComment in\n    Epilepsy Curr. 2007 May-Jun;7(3):68-70.\n\nPURPOSE: Previous reports have suggested that hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\ncould increase seizure activity in women with epilepsy. We sought to determine\nwhether adding HRT to the medication regimen of postmenopausal women with\nepilepsy was associated with an increase in seizure frequency.\nMETHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the\neffect of HRT on seizure frequency in postmenopausal women with epilepsy, taking \nstable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and within 10 years of their last\nmenses. After a 3-month prospective baseline, subjects were randomized to\nplacebo, Prempro (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate or CEE/MPA) daily, or double-dose CEE/MPA daily for a\n3-month treatment period.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were randomized after completing baseline. The\nsubjects' ages ranged from 45 to 62 years (mean, 53 years; SD, +/-5), and the\nnumber of AEDs used ranged from none to three (median, one). Five (71%) of seven \nsubjects taking double-dose CEE/MPA had a worsening seizure frequency of at least\none seizure type, compared with four (50%) of eight taking single-dose CEE/MPA\nand one (17%) of six taking placebo (p = 0.05). An increase in seizure frequency \nof the subject's most severe seizure type was associated with increasing CEE/MPA \ndose (p = 0.008). An increase in complex partial seizure frequency also was\nassociated with increasing CEE/MPA dose (p = 0.05). Two subjects taking\nlamotrigine had a decrease in lamotrigine levels of 25-30% while taking CEE/MPA.\nCONCLUSIONS: CEE/MPA is associated with a dose-related increase in seizure\nfrequency in postmenopausal women with epilepsy. CEE/MPA may decrease lamotrigine\nlevels.\n\nPMID: 16981859  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

For the last six months, all received the 1 +\n2.5 dosage. The 2 + 2.5 dosage was discontinued at the end of year 7. A total of \n198 women continued after year 7.\nRESULTS: Annualized percentage rates for cardiovascular events [corrected] and\nendometrial cancers [corrected] were below national rates for Finland and those\nreported for the Women's Health Initiative. There were no serious events with the\n1 + 2.5 dosage or after ccHRT discontinuation. Climacteric symptoms remained\nsignificantly below baseline values after dosage reduction; some symptoms\nrecurred after discontinuation of ccHRT. HRQOL ratings improved with ccHRT,\nirrespective of dosage, including depressed mood, anxiety, health perception and \nsexual interest. Scores on a scale assessing daily functioning and enjoyment\n(Q-LES-Q) improved from year 7 to year 9. They deteriorated during follow-up in\nwomen not continuing ccHRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower dosages of HRT were as effective as higher doses in improving \nclimacteric symptoms and HRQOL ratings and had fewer safety concerns. Following\ndiscontinuation of ccHRT, patient satisfaction was variable, with 15% electing to\ncontinue or restart HRT and 7% resuming at follow-up. This supports the need for \nan individualized approach to therapy recommendations.\n\nPMID: 16953985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Patients in the DMPA-SC 104 group showed\nsignificantly less BMD loss than did leuprolide patients at month 6, with scores \nreturning to baseline at 12 months' follow-up. No statistically significant\ndifferences in median weight changes were observed between groups. Compared with \nleuprolide, DMPA-SC 104 was associated with fewer hypoestrogenic symptoms but\nmore irregular bleeding.\nCONCLUSION(S): Efficacy of DMPA-SC 104 was equivalent to that of leuprolide for\nreducing endometriosis-associated pain, with less impact on BMD and fewer\nhypoestrogenic side effects but more bleeding.\n\nPMID: 16595206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The\naim of this study was to investigate whether agl\xc3\xa9pristone, a progesterone\nreceptor antagonist, can be used to treat this form of canine acromegaly. In five\nBeagle bitches hypersomatotropism was induced by administration of MPA for over 1\nyear. Subsequently, agl\xc3\xa9pristone was administered. Blood samples were collected\nbefore MPA administration, immediately before, during, and 3.5 and 5.5 weeks\nafter the last administration of agl\xc3\xa9pristone for determination of the plasma\nconcentrations of GH and IGF-I. In addition, blood samples for the determination \nof the 6-h plasma profile of GH were collected before MPA administration, before \nagl\xc3\xa9pristone administration, and 1 week after the last agl\xc3\xa9pristone treatment.\nMPA administration resulted in a significant increase of the mean plasma IGF-I\nconcentration, whereas analysis of the pulsatile plasma profile demonstrated a\ntrend (P=0.06) for a higher mean basal plasma GH concentration and a higher mean \nAUC(0) for GH. Treatment with agl\xc3\xa9pristone resulted in a significant decrease of \nthe mean plasma GH and IGF-I concentrations. Analysis of the pulsatile plasma\nprofile showed a trend (P=0.06) for a lower mean basal plasma GH concentration\nand a lower mean AUC(0) for GH 1 week after the last agl\xc3\xa9pristone treatment\ncompared with these values before agl\xc3\xa9pristone administration. Three and a half\nand 5.5 weeks after the last agl\xc3\xa9pristone administration the mean plasma IGF-I\nconcentration increased again. In conclusion, agl\xc3\xa9pristone can be used\nsuccessfully to treat dogs with progestin-induced hypersomatotropism.\n\nPMID: 16497368  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This study was designed to investigate\nthe effect of transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on carotid IMT and\nvascular inflammatory markers in postmenopausal women and to explore the\ninterrelationship between the change in carotid IMT and the changes in vascular\ninflammatory markers. Thirty-five postmenopausal women (mean age 57.0+/-7.7\nyears) received transdermal HRT (continuous 17beta-estradiol patch [36\nmicrog/day] plus cyclic oral medroxyprogesterone acetate [2.5 mg/day, for 12\ndays/ month]) for 12 months, and 32 controls (mean age 58.0+/-7.5 years) did not.\nCarotid IMT, assessed by ultrasound, and circulating vascular inflammatory\nmarkers, i.e., C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule\n(ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, E-selectin, monocyte\nchemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 were\nmeasured before and after 12 months of treatment. In the HRT group, carotid IMT\ndecreased significantly (p<0.01), from 0.71+/-0.13 mm to 0.65+/-0.12 mm, and the \nICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and MCP-1 levels decreased significantly (p<0.01 for \nall), but the CRP and MMP-9 levels remained unchanged. Carotid IMT and vascular\ninflammatory markers were unchanged in the control group. In the HRT group, the\nchange in carotid IMT was significantly correlated with the change in serum\nE-selectin (r=0.38, p<0.05), but not with the changes in other vascular\ninflammatory markers. These results suggest that transdermal HRT reduced carotid \nartery wall thickness, and that the reduction may have been induced by an\nantiatherosclerotic effect combined with the direct effect of estrogen and\ndecreased levels of estrogen-induced E-selectin.\n\nPMID: 16335886  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ninety-five adolescents\nseeking injectable contraception were randomized to receive 150 mg of DMPA as\nfollows: a deltoid injection of 1.0 mL from a single-unit-dose vial containing\n150 mg/mL or 0.38 mL from a multidose vial containing 400 mg/mL of DMPA. A visual\nanalogue scale was measured at each visit and cumulatively compared between the\ngroups. Continuation rates were tabulated. The report of pain for the multidose\nvial group was significantly higher than for the unit-dose vial group (p<.003).\nThe dropout rates for both groups were high at 1 year and were not statistically \ndifferent (multidose group=64% and unit-dose group=77%). Twenty percent of the\nsubjects in the multidose group vs. 22% in the unit-dose group discontinued due\nto bleeding irregularities. The concentrated form of DMPA led to greater pain at \nthe injection site than did the less concentrated form, but this did not lead to \nhigher discontinuation rates among adolescents.\n\nPMID: 16022852  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fasting\nblood samples were collected at baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 months of\ntreatment for measurement of serum concentrations of cholesterol by means of\ngas-liquid chromatography; 24S-hydroxycholesterol (cerebrosterol), lathosterol,\nand the plant sterol campesterol by means of gas-liquid chromatography-mass\nspectrometry. The analyses were performed retrospectively from serum samples\nstored at -70 degrees C for 5 years.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four months of treatment with raloxifene 150 mg was associated\nwith a significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations (-10%, P =\n0.007). The ratio of 24S-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol, a serum marker of\nbrain cholesterol metabolism, showed a significant increase after 6 and 12 months\nwith raloxifene 150 mg but not after 24 months (P = 0.001). The ratio of\nlathosterol to cholesterol, a marker of whole-body cholesterol synthesis,\nincreased with raloxifene 60 mg (P = 0.163), raloxifene 150 mg (P < 0.001), as\nwell as with HT (P = 0.005). The ratio of campesterol to cholesterol, a marker of\ncholesterol absorption rate, was significantly reduced with HT (P = 0.002).\nCONCLUSION: Two-year treatment with raloxifene or HT had no influence on brain\ncholesterol metabolism, while whole-body cholesterol synthesis, assessed by the\nratio of lathosterol to cholesterol, increased during raloxifene and HT.\n\nPMID: 15780532  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hormone\nreplacement therapy (HRT) seems to diminish the disruption of sleep in\nclimacteric women. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a low\ndose of conjugated equine estrogens (CE) in combination with different progestins\n(LD-HRT) and evaluate differences between regimens on sleep in symptomatic\npostmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women were recruited and assigned to\ncalcium-vitamin (control group) or to LD-HRT with 0.3mg of CE associated with a\ndaily administration at bedtime of a progestin (2.5 mg MPA, CE + MPA, n = 20), or\n100 mg natural micronized progesterone (CE + P, n = 20). Subjective symptoms were\nevaluated by the Greene climacteric scale, and by a visuanalogic graduated scale \n(0-10) at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of study. Greene's scores for the\ncontrol group were similar to those in LD-HRT group at baseline, and showed no\nsignificant modification at all subsequent measurements. Conversely, in LD-HRT\ngroup, a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the scores of all Greene's domains\nwas evident versus corresponding baseline and control group values. Conversely,\nin LD-HRT group, a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the scores of all Greene's\ndomains was evident with no difference in the scores of the two treated group.\nBoth CE + MPA and CE + P significantly (P = 0.05) reduced the HF and sleep\nvisuanalogic score in comparison to the control group. The score of sleep was\nsignificantly (P = 0.05) lower in the CE + P group in comparison to that measured\nin the CE + MPA group. No significant correlation between sleep and vasomotor\nscore was found. In conclusion, low estrogen dose may have a value in the\ntreatment of menopausal women in which sleep disturbances may be a symptom of\nestrogen deprivation. Low-dose estrogen associated with low-dose micronized\nprogesterone may especially benefit women who complain of disturbed sleep.\n\nPMID: 15653005  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Twelve items for\nmeasuring climacteric symptoms and well-being were reported daily on a validated \nsymptom scale.\nRESULTS: Women taking CE/MPA reported lower scores for breast tenderness (p =\n0.005), depression (p = 0.019), irritability (p = 0.004) and tension (p = 0.048),\ncompared with women taking E2/NETA. Compared with pretreatment, both groups\ndeveloped side-effects during the first week: breast tenderness, swelling and\ndepression (p < 0.05). Starters, but also switchers, improved in sweats (p <\n0.001 and p = 0.030). Compared with pretreatment ratings, switchers reported\nhigher scores for breast tenderness (p < 0.001), depression (p = 0.050) and\nnegative effects on daily life (p < 0.001), whereas starters reported only\nphysical side-effects (p < 0.05).

They were\ndivided in 2 groups: premenopause in treatment with estradiol-medroxyprogesterone\nand postmenopause with tibolona. We studied cardiovascular system, the bone mass \nand memory. The statistical analysis was by means of t Student for difference\nbetween the groups.\nRESULTS: With the estradiol-medroxyprogesterone use, the blood pressure\ndiminished significaticantly just for systolic pressure (-10.22/-6.38 mmHg).\nCholesterol and triglyceride, both diminished significantly (-43.92 mg and -58.79\nmg). There is not significance for the bone mass of lumbar-spine and femoral neck\n(+0.68% and +0.69%) as neither in the memory test (20-22). With the tibolona use,\nthe blood pressure was not reduced significantly (-6.93/-1.94 mmHg), with single \nsignificant reduction for cholesterol (-25.83 mg and -18.15 mg), presenting bone \nmass significant improvement just for femoral neck (+0.13% and +0.84%) and\nwithout improving in the memory test (17-18).\nCONCLUSIONS: A diminution of lipids with the estradiol-medroxyprogesterone use,\nas well as reduction of the cholesterol and improvement of the bone mass with the\ntibolona use but without benefits in the memory test with both treatments.\n\nPMID: 15239560  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The effect of estrogen-alone therapy, also evaluated in WHIMS,\non cognition has not been established for this population.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine whether conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) alters global\ncognitive function in older women and to compare its effect with CEE plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE plus MPA).\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\nancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), WHIMS evaluated the\neffect of CEE on incidence of probable dementia among community-dwelling women\naged 65 to 79 years with prior hysterectomy from 39 US academic centers that\nstarted in June 1995. Of 3200 eligible women free of probable dementia enrolled\nin the WHI, 2947 (92.1%) were enrolled in WHIMS. Analyses were conducted on the\n2808 women (95.3%) with a baseline and at least 1 follow-up measure of global\ncognitive function before the trial's termination on February 29, 2004.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants received 1 daily tablet containing either 0.625 mg of\nCEE (n = 1387) or matching placebo (n = 1421).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Global cognitive function measured annually with the\nModified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE).\nRESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 5.4 years, mean (SE) 3MSE scores were 0.26\n(0.13) units lower than among women assigned to CEE compared with placebo (P\n=.04). For pooled hormone therapy (CEE combined with CEE plus MPA), the mean (SE)\ndecrease was 0.21 (0.08; P =.006). Removing women with dementia, mild cognitive\nimpairment, or stroke from the analyses lessened these differences. The adverse\neffect of hormone therapy was more pronounced among women with lower cognitive\nfunction at baseline (all P<.01). For women assigned to CEE compared with\nplacebo, the relative risk of having a 10-unit decrease in 3MSE scores (>2 SDs)\nwas estimated to be 1.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.07).\nCONCLUSION: For women aged 65 years or older, hormone therapy had an adverse\neffect on cognition, which was greater among women with lower cognitive function \nat initiation of treatment.\n\nPMID: 15213207  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Incidence rates for\nprobable dementia in the estrogen-alone trial were statistically similar to those\nin the estrogen plus progestin trial (45 vs 22 per 10 000 person-years for CEE\nplus MPA vs placebo, respectively; P =.11). When data were pooled per the\noriginal WHIMS protocol, the overall HR for probable dementia was 1.76 (95% CI,\n1.19-2.60; P =.005). After excluding participants with baseline Modified\nMini-Mental State Examination scores at or below the screening cut point, the HR \nwas 1.77 (95% CI, 0.74-4.23; P =.20) in the estrogen-alone trial and 2.19 (95%\nCI, 1.25-3.84; P =.006) in the pooled trials. In the estrogen-alone trial, 76\nparticipants were diagnosed with MCI in the CEE group vs 58 in the placebo group \n(HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.95-1.89). In the combined trial data, the HR was similar\n(1.25; 95% CI, 0.97-1.60). In the estrogen-alone trial, 93 participants receiving\nCEE were diagnosed with either probable dementia or MCI vs 69 receiving placebo\n(HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01-1.89; P =.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen therapy alone did not reduce dementia or MCI incidence and \nincreased the risk for both end points combined. Pooling data for estrogen alone \nand estrogen plus progestin resulted in increased risks for both end points. Use \nof hormone therapy to prevent dementia or cognitive decline in women 65 years of \nage or older is not recommended.\n\nPMID: 15213206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and\nlipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and \n513 controls.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen\nplus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were\ncentrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and\n107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were\nischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat\nhazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence\ninterval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95%\nCI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for\nhemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate\nthat excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories \nof baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior\nhistory of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other\nrisk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use\nof vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white\nblood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of\nestrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in\ngenerally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to\nestrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women\nexamined.\n\nPMID: 12771114  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

On July 8, 2002, the study drugs, estrogen plus\nprogestin, in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial were discontinued because\nof certain increased health risks in women receiving combined hormone therapy.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of estrogen plus progestin on the incidence of \ndementia and mild cognitive impairment compared with placebo.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study\n(WHIMS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, began\nenrolling participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus\nprogestin trial in May 1996. Of the 4894 eligible participants of the WHI study, \n4532 (92.6%) postmenopausal women free of probable dementia, aged 65 years or\nolder, and recruited from 39 of 40 WHI clinical centers were enrolled in the\nWHIMS.\nINTERVENTION: Participants received either 1 daily tablet of 0.625 mg of\nconjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2229),\nor a matching placebo (n = 2303).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) and mild \ncognitive impairment (secondary outcome) were identified through a structured\nclinical assessment.\nRESULTS: The mean (SD) time between the date of randomization into WHI and the\nlast Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) for all WHIMS participants was\n4.05 (1.19) years. Overall, 61 women were diagnosed with probable dementia, 40\n(66%) in the estrogen plus progestin group compared with 21 (34%) in the placebo \ngroup. The hazard ratio (HR) for probable dementia was 2.05 (95% confidence\ninterval [CI], 1.21-3.48; 45 vs 22 per 10 000 person-years; P =.01). This\nincreased risk would result in an additional 23 cases of dementia per 10 000\nwomen per year. Alzheimer disease was the most common classification of dementia \nin both study groups. Treatment effects on mild cognitive impairment did not\ndiffer between groups (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.74-1.55; 63 vs 59 cases per 10 000\nperson-years; P =.72).\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the risk for probable\ndementia in postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older. In addition, estrogen\nplus progestin therapy did not prevent mild cognitive impairment in these women. \nThese findings, coupled with previously reported WHI data, support the conclusion\nthat the risks of estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits.\n\nPMID: 12771112  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A global index summarizing the balance of risks and \nbenefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE),\nendometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other\ncauses.\nRESULTS: On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and\nsafety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin\nvs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the\nstopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic\nsupported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major\nclinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal \n95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286\ncases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85)\nwith 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63\n(0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases;\nhip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes,\n0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for\ncomposite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease\n(arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76\n(0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and\n1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000\nperson-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8\nmore strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk\nreductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer\nhip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index\nwas 19 per 10 000 person-years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen\nplus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US \nwomen. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit\nprofile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable \nintervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate\nthat this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of \nCHD.\n\nPMID: 12117397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Ogen/Provera Study Group.\n\nNand SL(1), Webster MA, Baber R, Heller GZ.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)School of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal Hospital for Women, Barker Street,\nRandwick, NSW, 2031, Australia.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To establish the optimum oral daily dose of micronized\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), given in combination with 1.25 mg of estrone\nsulfate for menopausal symptom control.\nMETHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted on 568\npostmenopausal women who were randomized to take estrone sulfate 1.25 mg daily\nwith 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg of MPA daily for 2 years. The number of vasomotor symptoms\nand the severity of mood swings, lethargy, vaginal dryness and loss of libido as \nwell as side-effects were recorded in a diary. Blood pressure and weight were\nrecorded at each 3-month visit.\nRESULTS: Vasomotor symptoms were reported by approximately 80% of subjects at\nmonth 1, 23% at month 3 but only 9% by month 24. Mood swings, lethargy and\nvaginal dryness improved rapidly in the initial 3 months of therapy. Decrease in \nlibido had a slower response to therapy in all three treatment groups. Breast\ntenderness was the commonest side-effect with 22% of subjects complaining of this\nin the first 3 months of therapy, dropping to 13% by 6 months. Headache,\ndepression, nausea, bloating and irritability showed a similar pattern of\ndecline. There was no significant difference in the rate of decrease in\nmenopausal symptoms or reported side-effects between the three treatment groups. \nThere was a small but significant (p < 0.001) decrease in systolic and diastolic \nblood pressure over the study period.\nCONCLUSIONS: All three treatment regimens provide adequate symptom control.\nSide-effects decreased markedly after the first 3 months, with no significant\ndifference between the treatment groups.\n\nPMID: 11913409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ten postmenopausal females with predominantly partial\nupper airway obstruction during sleep had an overnight sleep study at baseline,\non the fourteenth day of treatment with MPA and after a 3-week washout period.\nSix subjects on nCPAP were also studied 3 months later. At baseline, the\novernight mean+/-SD end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide (Pet,CO2) was 5.5+/-0.4 \nkPa the arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) 93.0+/-1.2%, Sa,O2 nadir 80.0+/-6.7%, \nand frequency of oxygen desaturation > or = 4% (ODI4) per hour 2.2+/-1.3. MPA\ndecreased Pet,CO2 by 0.8 kPa (14.5%, p<0.001). After washout, the mean Pet,CO2\nremained at 0.5 kPa (9.1%, p<0.001) lower than at baseline. Sa,O2 did not change.\nPet,CO2 was lower on MPA than on nCPAP (4.7+/-0.2 kPa versus 5.0+/-0.3 kPa;\np=0.037) but Sa,O2 was similar. Apnoea/hypopnoea index tended to be lower on CPAP\nthan on MPA. Medroxyprogesterone acetate at a daily dose of 60 mg improves\nventilation in postmenopausal females with partial upper airway obstruction\nduring sleep without compromising sleep. The ventilatory improvement is sustained\nfor at least 3 weeks posttreatment. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was more\nefficient in decreasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide but continuous\npositive airway pressure was superior in decreasing respiratory efforts.\n\nPMID: 11829107  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In two separate studies, eight GHD women randomly received either oral\nor transdermal estrogen for 8 wk before crossing over to the alternate route of\nadministration. The first study assessed the effects of incremental doses of GH\n(0.5, 1.0, 2.0 IU/day for 1 wk each) on insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)\nlevels during each estrogen treatment phase. The second study assessed the\neffects of GH (2 IU/day) on lipid oxidation and on protein metabolism using the\nwhole body leucine turnover technique. Mean IGF-I level was significantly lower\nduring oral estrogen treatment (P < 0.05) and rose dose dependently during GH\nadministration by a lesser magnitude (P < 0.05) compared with transdermal\ntreatment. Postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly lower with oral\nestrogen treatment, both before (P < 0.05) and during (P < 0.05) GH\nadministration, compared with transdermal treatment. Protein synthesis was lower \nduring oral estrogen both before and during GH administration (P < 0.05). Oral\nestrogen antagonizes several of the metabolic actions of GH. It may aggravate\nbody composition abnormalities already present in GHD women and attenuate the\nbeneficial effects of GH therapy. Estrogen replacement in GHD women should be\nadministered by a nonoral route.\n\nPMID: 11701433  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A recent pre-clinical study revealed that CPA\nupregulates dThdPase activity specifically in tumor cells. Furthermore, clinical \ntrials have shown significant response rates in breast cancer patients, when\nusing the chemotherapy combination of 5'-DFUR, CPA and MPA. The purpose of this\nstudy was to examine the efficacy of this regimen as a pain reduction therapy for\nbreast cancer patients with bone metastasis. Ten patients who had bone metastasis\nwith restricted ADL were included in the study. All of the patients had had\nprevious exposure to such standard chemotherapy as CAF, CMF, taxol and oral 5-FU \nadministration. The patients were administered daily oral doses of 5'-DFUR at\n800-1,200 mg, CPA at 200 mg and MPA at 400-800 mg for two weeks as induction\ntherapy, followed by two weeks rest (one to two cycles). Daily dose of 800 mg of \n5'-DFUR, 100 mg of CPA, 400-800 mg of MPA was continuously administered\nthereafter. The main findings included a significant decrease in pain in eight\npatients, which continued for more than 6 months. In five patients, the effect\nlasted more than one year. As the pain decreased, the patients' QOL was improved.\nHematological toxicity of more than grade 3 was observed in three patients but\nonly during the induction therapy. One patient had pulmonary thrombosis and\nrequired hospitalization. In conclusion, oral administration of 5'-DFUR/CPA/MPA\nis well tolerated and useful in reducing pain.\n\nPMID: 11478147  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The distribution of the studied parameters were\ntested by means of a Skewness test. ANOVA analysis was used for normally\ndistributed variables and Friedman's analysis and Mann-Whitney U-test for non\nnormally distributed variables.\nRESULTS: There was a difference between the 30 women who participated all through\nthe study and the 18 who dropped out. It was noticeable that anxiety-depression\nand sleep disturbances were significantly more common among the drop outs. There \nwas a significant reduction in symptom score during the study, without any\nsignificant difference between the treatment groups. The sleep disturbances and\nanxiety-depression score improved significantly from before treatment to the end \nof the follow-up, but the anxiety-depression score increased during the nafarelin\ntreatment period. There was a statistically significant improvement of paid\nworking life in the nafarelin treated group. All the other psycho-social\nparameters as well as emotional balance improved during the study period without \ndifference between groups.\nCONCLUSION: When hormonal treatment is planned it is very important to take into \nconsideration previous psychosocial experiences of the patient. Factors of\nimportance for quality of life such as sleep disturbances and anxiety-depression \nimproved significantly after treatment with nafarelin or medroxyprogesterone\nacetate.\n\nPMID: 11437721  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There are no randomized trial data on the association of\nhormone treatment with knee or hip OA, and no studies have been published\nregarding the relationship of hormone treatment to knee or hip symptoms. This\nstudy examined the association of hormone treatment with prevalent knee symptoms \nand disability related to knee pain as assessed at the final visit of the Heart\nand Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS).\nMETHODS: The HERS was a 4-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\nof estrogen plus medroxy progesterone acetate for prevention of coronary heart\ndisease in postmenopausal women with documented coronary disease. Participants in\nthis substudy on knee pain were 969 postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 66\nyears and mean body mass index of 28.6 kg/m2, attending the final visit at 9\nclinical centers. Frequent knee symptoms were assessed by interview and the\nseverity of knee pain and disability related to knee pain were determined using\nthe Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Knee \nsymptoms and disability were compared between women assigned to receive hormones \nand those assigned to receive placebo.\nRESULTS: Frequent knee pain was reported in 24.1% of women assigned to receive\nhormone therapy versus 26.1% of those assigned to the placebo group, a difference\nof -2.0% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -7.4% to 3.5%). Among women with knee \npain, there were no differences in the severity of pain (score difference -0.2,\n95% CI -1.2 to 0.8) or disability (score difference -0.7, 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4) as \nassessed on the WOMAC. All results were similar for women whose body mass index\nwas either above or below the median.\nCONCLUSION: In a group of older, postmenopausal women with cardiac disease, we\nfound no significant effect of 4 years of estrogen plus progestin therapy\ncompared with placebo on knee pain and related disability. Our findings may not\napply to other groups of women or to the effect of hormone therapy on the\nstructural changes of knee OA.\n\nPMID: 11315920  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Matteo, University of Pavia,\nPiazzale Golgi 2, 27100, Pavia, Italy. renappi@tin.it\n\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate how hormone replacement\ntherapy (HRT) could influence the course of primary headaches in postmenopausal\nwomen.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients presenting for clinical evaluation of menopausal status\nand suffering from headache were enrolled. The observational period lasted 7\nmonths during which women filled in a diary with the clinical characteristics of \nheadache attacks (frequency, days with headache, severity) and the analgesic use \n(no. of analgesic/month). Climacteric symptoms and both anxiety and depression\nwere also measured. At the first visit the patients were divided into two groups:\nthose suffering from migraine without aura (MwA) and those suffering from\nepisodic tension-type headache (ETTH) and separately randomized. After a month of\nrun-in period, they received two different HRT regimen, either: (1) transdermal\nestradiol 50 mcg every 7 days for 28 days plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) \n10 mg/day from 15th to 28th day, or (2) oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/day\nfor 28 days plus MAP 10 mg/day for the last 14 days. Follow up evaluations were\nplanned after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment.\nRESULTS: While we did not observe any significance change regarding headache\nparameters in ETTH patients during both transdermal and oral treatment, the\ncourse of migraine was significantly affected by the route of HRT. Both frequency\nof attacks (F = 8.5; P < 0.000) and days with headache (F = 6.9; P < 0.000)\nsignificantly increased during HRT in the subgroup assuming oral formulation. On \nthe contrary, no changes in the same parameters were found in the group taking\ntransdermal treatment. Moreover, while severity of migraine was unaffected by\nHRT, analgesic consumption was significantly increased in the subgroup on oral\ntreatment (F = 6.3; P = 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: HRT significantly affects the course of headache in postmenopausal\nmigraine sufferers. Indeed, while the clinical pattern of ETTH remained stable\nthroughout the observational period, patients suffering from MwA worsened their\nsymptoms within the first 3 months of treatment. In particular, the oral route of\nadministration significantly worsened migraine in comparison to the transdermal\nroute.\n\nPMID: 11306204  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Menopause. 1999 Fall;6(3):196-200.\n\nHormone replacement therapy may alleviate sleep apnea in menopausal women: a\npilot study.\n\nKeefe DL(1), Watson R, Naftolin F.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Reproductive Medicine and Infertility, Women and Infants Hospital,\nBrown University School of Medicine, Providence, RI 02905, USA.\n\nComment in\n    Menopause. 1999 Fall;6(3):186-7.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The incidence of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) in women increases after\nmenopause. Progestins alone do not alleviate SAS in menopausal women. However,\nprogestins may require concomitant estrogen administration and estrogen alone may\nstimulate breathing during sleep. To test these hypotheses, we studied the\neffects of estrogen alone and estrogen combined with progestin on SAS in\nmenopausal women, using a prospective, cross-over, inception cohort study.\nDESIGN: In this pilot study, five women who developed SAS after menopause\nunderwent 2 nights of polysomnography to obtain a baseline, then returned for\npolysomnography after 3-4 weeks of taking micronized 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and\nafter 10-12 days of taking E2 combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (E2 + P).\nSleep stages were scored according to Rechtshaffen and Kales, frequency and\nlength of apneas were recorded for each subject each night, and the data were\nanalyzed by Student's t test.\nRESULTS: E2 and E2 + P both reduced the Respiratory Distress Index. E2 also\nraised the lowest oxygen desaturation associated with apneic episodes. Total\nminutes of rapid eye movement sleep increased, and the number of waking episodes \ndecreased when the women were taking E2 and E2 + P, as previously reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Within 1 month after initiating E2 or E2 + P, SAS was reduced in all\npatients. The Respiratory Distress Index decreased by 25%, and the addition of\nprogestin brought the SAS reduction to 50% in this pilot study. A randomized\nstudy in a large group of patients is justified by the findings of this study.\nBecause SAS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and fatal accidents, the\namelioration of SAS by sex steroid hormones could have significant implications\nfor the health of menopausal women.\n\nPMID: 10486788  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Participants were\nassigned randomly to one of five groups: 1) placebo, 2) daily conjugated equine\nestrogens, 3) conjugated equine estrogens plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone\nacetate, 4) conjugated equine estrogens plus daily medroxyprogesterone acetate,\nand 5) conjugated equine estrogens plus cyclical micronized progesterone.\nSymptoms were self-reported using a checklist at 1 and 3 years. Factor analysis\nreduced 52 symptoms to a set of six symptom groups.\nRESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses at 1 year, each active treatment\ndemonstrated a marked, statistically significant, protective effect against\nvasomotor symptoms compared with placebo (odds ratios [ORs] 0.17-0.28); there was\nno additional benefit of estrogen-progestin over estrogen alone. Only\nprogestin-containing regimens were significantly associated with higher levels of\nbreast discomfort (OR 1.92-2.27). Compared with placebo, women randomized to\nconjugated equine estrogens reported no increase in perceived weight. Those\nrandomized to medroxyprogesterone acetate reported less perceived weight gain (OR\n0.61-0.69) than placebo. Anxiety, cognitive, and affective symptoms did not\ndiffer by treatment assignment. Analyses restricted to adherent women were not\nmaterially different than those using intention-to-treat, except that women\nadherent to medroxyprogesterone acetate and micronized progesterone regimens\nreported fewer musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 0.62-0.68).\nCONCLUSION: These results confirm the usefulness of post-menopausal hormone\ntherapy for hot flashes, show convincingly that estrogen plus progestin causes\nbreast discomfort, and demonstrate little influence of postmenopausal hormones on\nanxiety, cognition, or affect.\n\nPMID: 9840563  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Although the causes of mastalgia are poorly understood,\nimbalances in estrogen and progesterone effects in the breast have been\nimplicated. Progesterones have been proposed as a treatment for mastalgia, but\nthe literature supporting their use is conflicting and currently inconclusive.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The prevalence and severity of mastalgia in women receiving\nparenteral progesterones for contraception was compared to that of a randomly\nselected, age-matched control group using a validated survey instrument. Surveys \nwere completed by 671 case subjects and 1,433 randomly selected, age-matched\ncontrol subjects.\nRESULTS: Nine percent of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera,\nUpjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich) reported frequent breast pain compared to 21 percent of \ncontrol subjects (OR 0.220, p < 0.001). The prevalence of clinically significant \nbreast pain was 2.3 percent in the progesterone group compared to 4.9 percent in \nthe control group (p < 0.02). Focal, noncyclic mastalgia predominated in the\nprogesterone group with continued breast pain (78.8 percent), while diffuse,\ncyclic breast pain was more common in the control group (67.7 percent, p <\n0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Medroxyprogesterone acetate effectively suppresses cyclic mastalgia \nin reproductive-age women and warrants additional study as a primary therapy.\n\nPMID: 9179116  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Twenty-four \nwhite women, aged 14 to 28 years, with hypothalamic amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea \nwere prospectively enrolled for a 12-month intervention period. Amenorrheic\nsubjects were randomized to receive oral contraceptives, medroxyprogesterone, or \nplacebo. Oligomenorrheic subjects were randomized to receive medroxyprogesterone \nor placebo. Bone mineral was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at\nbaseline and at 6 and 12 months.\nRESULTS: In amenorrheic subjects spine and total body bone mineral measurements\nat 12 months were greater in the oral contraceptive group than in the\nmedroxyprogesterone and placebo groups when baseline bone mineral measurements,\nbody weight, and age were controlled for (p < or = 0.05). There were no\ndifferences in hip bone mineral calcium and bone mineral density measurements at \n12 months among the three groups. In oligomenorrheic subjects there was no\ndetectable improvement in bone mineral associated with medroxyprogesterone use.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that oral contraceptive use in\nwomen with hypothalamic amenorrhea will improve lumbar spine and total body bone \nmineral.\n\nPIP: The objectives of this study were to assess 1) whether treatment with oral\ncontraceptives (OCs), in comparison with medroxyprogesterone and placebo,\nimproved bone mineral content and density in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea\nand 2) whether treatment with medroxyprogesterone, in comparison with placebo,\nimproved bone mineral content and density in women with hypothalamic\noligomenorrhea. The study was a randomized, controlled clinical trial. 24 White\nwomen, aged 14-28 years, with hypothalamic amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea were\nprospectively enrolled for a 12-month intervention period.

However, due to the long-term effects of GnRH agonists on bone \nmass, their use is restricted to short courses. Add-back hormone replacement\ntherapy (HRT) is one strategy that could minimise the hypo-oestrogenic effects of\nGnRH agonists, without nullifying their therapeutic effects. In one study of\nadd-back therapy with cyclical oestradiol/norgestrol in combination with Zoladex \n(goserelin acetate) in women with subjective DUB, the duration of menstruation,\nthe number of days of heavy bleeding and objective blood loss were all\nsignificantly (P < 0.001) reduced. There was also significant (P < 0.001)\nsymptomatic improvement. Furthermore, in 51 patients with symptomatic uterine\nfibroids, combined oestrogen/progestogen given for 21 months after initial GnRH\nagonist treatment for 3 months did not promote fibroid regrowth. In contrast, in \nwomen randomised to progestogen only, there was a gradual increase in uterine\nvolume. The combination of GnRH agonists and add-back HRT appears beneficial for \nwomen with either DUB or fibroids.\n\nPMID: 8916983  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Contraception. 1996 Feb;53(2):115-9.\n\nUniject as a delivery system for the once-a-month injectable contraceptive\nCyclofem in Brazil.\n\nBahamondes L(1), Marchi NM, de Lourdes Cristofoletti M, Nakagava HM, Pellini E,\nAraujo F, Rubin J.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Departamento de Tocoginecologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP),\nBrasil.\n\nThis study assessed the administration of Cyclofem using prefilled Uniject\ndevices. A total of 480 injections were administered divided equally between\nstandard syringes and Uniject. The majority of women (82%) reported that they\nfelt anxious prior to receiving the injection with Uniject. After injection, more\nthan 80% expressed no anxiety about the appearance of Uniject or about the\ntechnique of injection. A total of 96.3% of the participants reported slight to\nno pain with Uniject. In comparison to the standard syringe, 5.6% expressed\nhaving had more pain with Uniject. Ninety percent of the service providers\nreported that Uniject was easy to activate and inject and that it was reassuring \nfor users to know that the syringe and needle had never been used previously.\nOnly two service providers demonstrated difficulties in activating the device. No\naccidental punctures occurred during the manipulation, and incomplete emptying of\nthe Uniject was not observed. In conclusion, Uniject is a good device for the\nadministration of the injectable contraceptive Cyclofem. It is likely to be\nappropriate for the delivery of other injectable contraceptives after the\nnecessary stability tests have been performed.\n\nPMID: 8838489  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A study by the Italian Trials in Medical Oncology Group.\n\nDi Leo A(1), Bajetta E, Buzzoni R, Bochicchio AM, Nol\xc3\xa8 F, Biganzoli L, D'Aprile\nM, Veltri E, Comella G, Aitini E, et al.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Medical Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei\nTumori, Milan, Italy.\n\nThe evaluation of drug efficacy in patients with advanced prostatic cancer who\nhave progressed to hormonal therapy is difficult, although palliation of the pain\nrelated to bone involvement still represents an important endpoint. In this\nstudy, epirubicin (EpiADM) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were given to\nadvanced prostatic cancer patients with symptomatic bone involvement who had\nprogressed to hormonal therapy. EpiADM was administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2\ni.v. weekly and MPA at a daily dose of 1,000 mg p.o. for the first month and 500 \nmg thereafter. Fifty-four patients entered the trial, all of whom were evaluable.\nAmelioration of pain and a > or = 50% reduction in analgesic intake were observed\nin 52% of cases, with a mean duration of 4 months. Of the 28 responsive patients,\n26 had already received two lines of hormonal therapy or were resistant to\nfirst-line therapy. Of the 23 patients with measurable lesions, 6 obtained a > or\n= 50% tumor shrinkage at these sites. The treatment was well tolerated, and no\ncardiac toxicity was observed up to a total cumulative EpiADM dose of 660 mg/m2. \nIn conclusion, this regimen seems to have a palliative effect in patients with\nadvanced prostatic cancer who have progressed to hormonal therapy, and it is\nfeasible in an outpatient setting.\n\nPMID: 7538260  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Eight patients\ncompleted the entire protocol.\nINTERVENTIONS: Baseline overnight polysomnography was performed. On the second\nstudy night, subjects ingested 1 ml/kg body weight 50 percent ethanol prior to\nrepeat overnight polysomnography. If sleep apnea worsened, subjects then received\neither MPA (20 mg by mouth, three times a day) or placebo for 7 days then\nunderwent repeat polysomnography with the same ethanol dose. A washout period\nfollowed, then, the other drug was taken, followed again by polysomnography with \nantecedent ethanol ingestion.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) increased from 9.6 +/- 5.3\nevents/h (baseline) to 20.2 +/- 16.0 events/h on the ethanol night (p = 0.03).\nLow oxygen saturation (SaO2) fell to 79.2 +/- 5.1 percent on the ethanol night\ncompared to baseline, 85.0 +/- 3.7 percent (p < 0.01). MPA improved AHI, nonrapid\neye movement AHI, low SaO2, mean saturation nadir, number of desaturations\nbetween 80 and 90 percent, and the mean event desaturation when compared with the\nethanol alone night. All these parameters were likewise improved when compared\nwith placebo, although only the mean saturation nadir showed statistical\nsignificance. These findings were unchanged when also examined for the initial 3 \nhours of study.\nCONCLUSIONS: In obstructive sleep apnea patients whose disease is made worse by\nethanol ingestion, MPA appears to improve oxygenation during obstructive events\nbut not to improve their number or length.\n\nPMID: 8082361  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Treatment with diazepam has recently\nbeen gaining favor, particularly because of reported adverse effects of\nprogestins. Results of a clinical trial involving 20 cats indicated that diazepam\nwas effective in eliminating or markedly reducing spraying in 11 (55%) of them.\nHowever, most cats required continuous treatment, or at least intermittent\ntreatment, when spraying recurred. The physiologic and behavioral dependency of\ncats on diazepam, which presumably develops over the course of administration,\nmay contribute to the tendency for spraying to recur once diazepam treatment is\ndiscontinued. Using data from previously published findings on progestin\nadministration, plus additional cases, it was documented that a significantly (P \nless than 0.05) higher percentage of males than females responded favorably.\nAlthough the number of cases was not sufficient for a statistical comparison of\ndiazepam vs progestin treatment with regard to male vs female, possible gender\ndifference in the effectiveness of diazepam was not indicated.\n\nPMID: 1533207  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The switch to DMPA resulted in significant increases \nin HDL-C (33%), Apo A1 (12%), as well as in the HDL-C/LDL-C (48%) and Apo A1/Apo \nB (22%) ratios. The concentrations of HDL-C and Apo A1 were significantly greater\nin patients receiving DMPA, than in patients continuing with lynestrenol therapy.\nThe amenorrhea incidence, however, did not differ between the two therapy groups.\nIt is concluded that therapy with DMPA may be associated with smaller\natherosclerosis risk than with peroral lynestrenol, because of its weaker effect \non HDL-C and A1 levels.\n\nPMID: 1836088  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

No significant relief of pain or tenderness was found on \nplacebo or active treatment, irrespective of treatment order, and breast\nnodularity was similarly unaltered. No evidence of progesterone deficiency or\nprolactin abnormality was found. Side-effects were incurred in 11 patients (five \non placebo, five on active treatment and one while on both) and were mostly vague\npremenstrual symptoms. We conclude that the therapeutic response of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate in cyclical mastalgia is no better than placebo and\nthat progestogen supplementation can no longer be recommended for routine use in \nthe management of breast pain.\n\nPMCID: PMC2499117\nPMID: 2139769  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ten male patients with OSA syndrome underwent an\ninitial polysomnogram with monitoring of EEG, EOG, myohyoid EMG, oral and nasal\nairflow, abdominal and thoracic movement, and SaO2. The patients were then\nentered into a randomized, double-blind crossover study using MPA, 150 mg/day,\nand MPA placebo. Each patient took tablets for one week and then had a second\npolysomnogram. After a three week washout, the patient again took tablets for a\nweek prior to the third and final sleep study. There was no significant\ndifference between drug and placebo for DBE time (expressed as a percentage of\nsleep time), DBE frequency, DBE mean duration or mean fall in O2 saturation\nduring DBEs. We conclude that treatment with MPA does not alter indices of\nseverity of the OSA syndrome.\n\nPMID: 2526721  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We sought to determine whether combined progestin and estrogen\ntreatment decreased sleep-disordered breathing in healthy postmenopausal women.\nNine ovarihysterectomized women [50 +/- 2 (SE) yr of age] were studied after 1 wk\nof treatment with placebo (lactose) or combined progestin and estrogen\n(medroxyprogesterone acetate, 20 mg tid, and Premarin, 1.25 mg bid). Subjects\nshowed few respiratory disturbances during placebo treatment. Despite this,\ncombined progestin and estrogen administration reduced the number of\nsleep-disordered breathing episodes in every subject, decreasing the average\nnumber of episodes per subject from 15 +/- 4 to 3 +/- 1. The duration of\nhypopneas also decreased with hormone treatment. Thus the presence of progestin\nand estrogen may be involved in protecting premenopausal women against\nsleep-disordered breathing.\n\nPMID: 2543656  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ninety-two patients entered this\ntrial, of whom 86 were evaluable for final analysis. Hyperprolactinemic patients \n(n = 31) were randomized to receive VAC/FMC chemotherapy with or without\nbromoergocryptine. Normoprolactinemic patients with 'low risk' metastatic disease\n(disease-free interval greater than 30 months, ER/PR positive or unknown) were\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone acetate or VAC/FMC chemotherapy.\nNormoprolactinemic 'high risk' patients (n = 42) (disease-free interval less than\n30 months, EP/PR negative) received VAC/FMC chemotherapy with or without\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP). The results show that bromoergocryptine does\nnot improve response rate, duration of response and survival. Median survival of \npatients with elevated basal plasma prolactin (greater than 15 ng/ml) is reduced \nto 9 months compared to patients with normal basal plasma prolactin (17 months,\nlog-rank p = 0.005). Unexpectedly, TRH stimulation proved inappropriate to\nseparate normo- and hyperprolactinemic patients in terms of survival.\nNormoprolactinemic 'low risks' (tamoxifen failures) were observed to qualify for \nfurther hormone therapy (median survival 21+ months). Normoprolactinemic 'high\nrisks' showed median survival of about 12 months with no apparent benefit for\nthose receiving MAP, additionally. The results suggest that basal\nhyperprolactinemia, disease free interval, ER/PR receptor status, and liver\nmetastasis are important prognostic variables. Endocrine and cytotoxic\nchemotherapy should be selected according to these risk factors.\n\nPMID: 2950359  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

For approximately one month 11 \nsubjects received 30 mg of medroxyprogesterone (MPG) daily, and 10 received\nplacebo tablets in a randomized, double-blind controlled study. Respiration,\nsaturation and electroencephalography were monitored during one night of sleep\nbefore and one night after therapy. Contrasted with the low incidence of\ndisordered breathing and desaturation in premenopausal women, 71 percent of the\npostmenopausal women had such events. In the placebo-treated group, all measured \nvariables of sleep and breathing were identical on the two nights, which\nsuggested that the findings of a single night of sleep monitoring may be\nrepresentative of other nights of sleep. Although several subjects appeared to\nshow improvement with MPG, only the maximum duration of apnea was significantly\nreduced the second night (p less than 0.03).\n\nPIP: 21 postmenopausal women were monitored for sleep-disordered breathing and\nnocturnal oxygen desaturation to evaluate the contribution of progestational\nhormones to the occurrence of these sleep events.

In five subjects,\nplasmas were obtained before and during successful medical therapy with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The sixth subject was sampled before and after\ntransphenoidal Sr90-induced hypopituitarism. All subjects had a decrement in\nfasting growth hormone levels with respective therapies (29-88%). The in vitro\ngrowth hormone released from Rhesus monkey anterior pituitaries was assessed\nafter incubating one lateral half in control plasma (pre-therapy) and the\ncontralateral pituitary half in plasma obtained during or after therapy. Studies \nwith plasmas obtained from the five patients successfully treated with MPA showed\na decreased in growth hormone releasing activity during therapy in all (18-57%). \nPlasma obtained after Sr90 pituitary ablation in the sixth subject had 35% more\ngrowth hormone releasing activity than obtained before therapy. These results\nsuggest that active acromegalics who respond to MPA with significantly lowered\ngrowth hormone levels may actually achieve this response because of a decrease in\ngrowth hormone releasing factor measured peripherally. The opposite response in\none acromegalic subject, following Sr90 pituitary ablation and hypopituitarism,\nsuggests that growth hormone releasing factor secretion may increase when growth \nhormone levels are lowered by ablative therapy.\n\nPMID: 98420  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The average age was 63 years and the patients\nwere, on the average, 14 years' postmenopausal. Only two patients had received no\nprior additive hormone therapy. The remainder had previously received estrogen,\nandrogens, or both. Only two patients had objective evidence of tumor regression.\nIn one patient a metastatic node disappeared for 7+ months, and the other patient\nhad well-documented clinical improvement and control of brain mestastases for 22 \nmonths. Two other patients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases\n(regression of some but not all lesions), lasting 3 and 4 months respectively.\nFive other patients had obvious subjective benefit. There were four objective\nresponses (10%) and five subjective responses (12%). There was no correlation\nbetween route of administration and response. All patients receiving benefit had \npreviously responded to other hormones. Side effects were usually absent or\nconsisted of mild fluid retention; however, four patients had disease stimulation\nfrom therapy.\n\nPIP: Progesterone, like estrogens, is used in the treatment of metastatic breast \ncancer. The 3 most active derivatives are megestrol, norethisterone acetate, and \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). This study evaluates the use of MPA in\ntreating metastatic breast cancer in 40 postmenopausal women (average age, 63\nyears; average duration of postmenopause, 14 years) who have either not responded\nto or have relapsed after therapy with estrogens and androgens. 18 patients\nreceived a depot preparation of MPA intramuscularly in a loading dose of 3.2 g\nover a 2-week period and then 400 mg at 2-4 week intervals. 22 patients received \nthe drug orally in a dose of 200 to 300 mg daily. Patients were evaluated after 6\nweeks of therapy. Criteria for evaluating response were those used by the Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group. Only 2 of 40 patients exhibited an objective response\n(disappearance of metastatic lymph node for 9 months in 1 and well-documented\nclinical improvement and control of brain metastases for 22 months in another). 2\npatients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases (regression of some but not\nall lesions) lasting 3 and 4 months respectively. 5 patients had obvious\nsubjective response (pain relief) but no objective response. Overall response\nrate was 22%: 4 objective responses (10%) and 5 subjectives responses (12%).\nRoute of administration did not correlate with response. Tumor stimulation and\nclinical deterioration occurred in 4 patients. It appears that MPA therapy is\ncostly and of minimal usefulness as secondary therapy in metastatic breast\ncancer. Further studies should focus on megestrol and norethisterone acetate\nwhich have been documented to have better response rates.\nPMID: 1260780  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Although there was no significant\nweight change in the group, PaO2 rose 12.6 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (SEM) from 49 +/- 2.6 mm\nHg to 62 +/- 2.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), while PaCO2 fell 13 +/- 2.6 mm Hg\nfrom 51 +/- 1.9 mm Hg to 38 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Hematocrit fell\nfrom 56 +/- 2.5% to 50 +/- 1.2%, a mean fall of 6% (P less than 0.01), during\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. In the 2 patients who had cardiac\ncatheterization before and during medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy, mean\npulmonary arterial pressure fell 13 and 19 mm Hg. There were no recurrences of\ncor pulmonale during treatment. These effects on arterial blood gas values and\nclinical state were sustained during therapy. On withdrawal of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate during 1-month period, arterial oxygen and carbon\ndioxide tensions deteriorated to their previous pretreatment values.\nReinstitution of medroxyprogesterone acetate caused improvement in both the\noxygen and carbon dioxide tensions.

The effects of menopausal hormone \ntherapy on incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer and melanoma were evaluated in\npost hoc analyses of the Women's Health Initiative randomized placebo-controlled \nhormone therapy trials of combined estrogen plus progestin (E + P) and estrogen\nonly (E-alone).\nMETHODS: Postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years were randomly assigned to\nconjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5\nmg/d) or placebo in the E + P trial if they had an intact uterus (N = 16,608) or \nto conjugated equine estrogen alone or placebo in the E-alone trial if they had a\nhysterectomy (N = 10,739); the mean follow-up was 5.6 and 7.1 years,\nrespectively. Incident nonmelanoma skin cancers (n = 980 [E + P trial]; n = 820\n[E-alone trial]) and melanomas (n = 57 [E + P trial]; n =38 [E-alone trial]) were\nascertained by self-report. Incident cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma were\nconfirmed by physician review of medical records. Incidences of nonmelanoma skin \ncancer and melanoma were compared between the two randomization groups within\neach trial using hazard ratios (HRs), with corresponding 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) and Wald statistic P values from Cox proportional hazards models. All\nstatistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS: Rates of incident nonmelanoma skin cancer and melanoma were similar\nbetween the active hormone (combined analysis of E + P and E-alone) and placebo\ngroups (nonmelanoma skin cancer: HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.07; melanoma: HR =\n0.92, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.37). Results were similar for the E + P and E-alone\ntrials when analyzed individually.\nCONCLUSIONS: Menopausal hormone therapy did not affect overall incidence of\nnonmelanoma skin cancer or melanoma. These findings do not support a role of\nmenopausal estrogen, with or without progestin, in the development of skin cancer\nin postmenopausal women.\n\nPMCID: PMC3186783\nPMID: 21878677  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The WHO Collaborative Study of Neoplasia and Steroid\nContraceptives.\n\n[No authors listed]\n\nTo determine whether the long-acting progestational contraceptive,\ndepot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), alters risk of cervical cancer, a\nhospital-based case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Bangkok,\nThailand, and in one hospital each in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Mexico City, Mexico, \nand Nairobi, Kenya. Information on prior use of DMPA, screening for cervical\ncancer, and the suspected risk factors for this disease was ascertained from\ninterviews of 2,009 women with invasive squamous cell cervical cancer and 9,583\ncontrols. For selected subsets of these women, a smoking history was also\nelicited, blood specimens were collected for measurement of antibodies against\nherpes simplex and cytomegaloviruses, and information on sexual behavior was\nobtained from interviews with their husbands. The relative risk (and 95%\nconfidence interval) of invasive squamous cell cervical carcinoma in women who\never used DMPA was estimated to be 1.11 (0.96, 1.29). No trends in risk with\nduration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed.\nThese results provide reassurance that prolonged use of DMPA does not enhance\nrisk of invasive squamous cell cervical carcinomas, even after a potential latent\nperiod of over a decade.\n\nPMID: 1387601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub\n2009 Dec 4.\n\nEfficacy of venlafaxine, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate for\nthe treatment of vasomotor hot flushes in men taking gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone analogues for prostate cancer: a double-blind, randomised trial.\n\nIrani J(1), Salomon L, Oba R, Bouchard P, Mottet N.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Urology Unit, University Hospital, Poitiers, France. j.irani@chu-poitiers.fr\n\nComment in\n    Lancet Oncol. 2010 Feb;11(2):107-8.\n\nBACKGROUND: Hot flushes are the most common complaints reported by men undergoing\nandrogen suppression treatment for prostate cancer. We designed a randomised\ndouble-blind trial to compare the efficacy of three drugs, each of which has\nproven effective for preventing hot flushes in previous studies.\nMETHODS: Men with prostate cancer with an indication for androgen suppression\nwere enrolled in the study at 106 urology centres in France between April 14,\n2004, and April 20, 2007. All patients were treated for 6 months with leuprorelin\n(11.25 mg). At month 6, patients who spontaneously asked for treatment, or those \nwho presented with 14 hot flushes or more during the week before the visit, were \nrandomly assigned to either venlafaxine 75 mg daily, medroxyprogesterone acetate \n20 mg daily, or cyproterone acetate 100 mg daily. All patients received two\nindistinguishable pills in the morning and one in the evening from week 1 to week\n8, and one indistinguishable pill in the morning from week 9 to week 10, to\ncomply with the double-blind design. Random assignment with a block size of three\nwas done centrally, by fax, and each patient was given a randomisation number.\nThe allocation sequence was stratified by centre. Assessment was done at\ninclusion, at randomisation, and then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after\nrandomisation. Participants completed a daily hot-flush diary for 1 week, and a\nquality of life questionnaire before each visit throughout the study. The primary\noutcome was the change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation and \n1 month. All patients who received at least one study treatment dose were\nincluded in the efficacy analysis. This trial is registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01011751.\nFINDINGS: Of the 919 men initially enrolled, 311 were randomly assigned to one of\nthe study treatments at 6 months: 102 to venlafaxine, 101 to cyproterone, and 108\nto medroxyprogesterone. 309 patients were included in the efficacy analysis,\nsince two were excluded for protocol deviations (one in the cyproterone and one\nin the medroxyprogesterone group; both were excluded because they were already\nundergoing treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants at\nrandomisation). The change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation \nand 1 month was -47.2% (IQR -74.3 to -2.5) in the venlafaxine group, -94.5%\n(-100.0 to -74.5) in the cyproterone group, and -83.7% (-98.9 to -64.3) in the\nmedroxyprogesterone group. The decrease from baseline was significant for all\nthree groups (p<0.0001). Pairwise comparison of treatment groups adjusted by the \nBonferroni method confirmed that the decreases in hot-flush score were\nsignificantly larger in the cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone groups than in\nthe venlafaxine group, regardless of the interval considered (p<0.0001 in all\ncases). There was no significant difference between the cyproterone and\nmedroxyprogesterone groups (p>0.2 in all cases). Serious side-effects occurred in\nfour, seven, and five patients in the venlafaxine, cyproterone, and\nmedroxyprogesterone groups, respectively, of which none, one (dyspnoea), and one \n(urticaria) were considered related to the drug, respectively.\nINTERPRETATION: After 6 months of treatment with leuprorelin, venlafaxine,\ncyproterone, and medroxyprogesterone proved to be effective in reducing hot\nflushes. However, the hormonal treatments cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone\nwere significantly more effective than venlafaxine. As cyproterone is a\nrecognised treatment in prostate cancer, and its use could interfere with\nhormonal therapy, medroxyprogesterone could be considered to be the standard\ntreatment for hot flushes in men undergoing androgen suppression for prostate\ncancer.\nFUNDING: Takeda Laboratories, Puteaux, France.\n\nCopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of\nparenteral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in reducing the frequency and\nseverity of these hot flashes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective review of hot flashes \nfrom LHRH therapy for prostate cancer was conducted. The hot flashes were\nquantified and the severity was graded (3-point analogue scale) before and after \ntreatment with MPA. Two doses of MPA (400 or 150 mg intramuscularly) were\nadministered. Statistical analysis (Student's t test) evaluated the quantity of\nhot flashes, the quality of hot flashes, and dose effectiveness.\nRESULTS: A total of 48 men (40 at 400 mg, 8 at 150 mg) with a mean age of 71.4\nyears (range 54 to 87) from 3 institutions were evaluated. There were 91% with\nsymptomatic improvement with MPA, and half (46%) had a complete response defined \nas total elimination of hot flashes. The median number of the hot flashes per day\ndecreased from 4 to 1 and the median severity score decreased from 2 to 1 (p\n<0.05). Significance was not achieved comparing the 2 doses. Complete responders \nwere not noted with the 150 mg dose. Anticipated response to MPA did not\ncorrelate with the number or severity of the hot flashes.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first multi-institutional evaluation of hot\nflashes demonstrating significant reduction in quantity and severity with MPA.\nBased on these data we now manage hot flashes associated with LHRH analogues with\n400 mg of MPA.\n\nPMID: 16006929  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We\nstudied the effect of epirubicin, alone or combined with medroxy progesterone\nacetate (MPA), in this particular patient group. The aim of the study was to\ninvestigate the feasibility of quality of life (QOL) measurement and to ascertain\nwhether MPA added to epirubicin produces a better QOL than epirubicin alone.\nMETHODS: Of 28 randomized patients with symptomatic AHRPC, 26 were eligible for\nthe study. Fourteen of them received epirubicin (100 mg/m(2) i.v.) every 3 weeks \nin combination with an oral dose of 500 mg of MPA twice daily. Twelve patients\nreceived epirubicin alone. For the QOL assessment, the Rotterdam Symptom\nCheckliste was used. Toxic side effects of chemotherapy were assed by the WHO\ncriteria. Subjective responses included performance status and pain score.\nRESULTS: Compliance in completing QOL questionnaires was high (87.5%). In none of\nthe QOL domains studied did any of the patients, irrespective of their treatment,\nexperience an improvement in their QOL. Moreover, after 12 and 24 weeks, patients\nin both treatment arms experienced a significant worsening of physical symptom\ndistress when compared to study entry. Toxicity was moderate to severe. A\nbiochemical response (drop in prostate-specific antigen of more than 50%) was\nobserved in 5 out of 26 patients (19.1%) and a subjective response in 7 out of 26\npatients (26.9%). The median survival for all patients was 30 weeks. There was no\nstatistically significant difference between the two arms. Performance status and\nthe global QOL as judged by the patients themselves were associated with the\nduration of survival. No relation was found between the initial observed\nsubjective response and survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of measuring QOL in patients with symptomatic AHRPC \nis demonstrated in the present study. Subjective and biochemical responses were\nobserved in both treatment arms, but these were not translatable as improved\nmeasured QOL domains.\n\nPMID: 10940698  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Middelheim, Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe Genito-Urinary Tract Cancer Cooperative Group (GU Group) is one of the 18\nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) cooperative\ngroups. It was established as a nonprofit organization in 1976 with the aim of\nconducting phase II and phase III clinical trials. Its membership includes\nurologists, oncologists, radiotherapists, and endocrinologists that work in close\ncollaboration with its five data managers and one statistician in the EORTC Data \nCenter. Eight subcommittees meet independently to plan and to monitor urological \ntrials and to design programs on quality of life and quality control. In the past\n20 years, 3,500 prostate cancer patients have been recruited in 16 phase III\ntrials in untreated and advanced disease and in seven phase II trials in\nhormone-refractory, metastatic disease. This vast experience led the EORTC GU\nGroup to be involved in the development of response and progression criteria, as \nwell as the validation of prognostic factors, quality of life questionnaires, and\nbasic expertise on the design and analysis of prostate cancer trials, including\nthe meta-analysis of the trials with maximal androgen blockade. The conclusions\ndrawn out of this large pool of experience show the complexity of the clinical\nresearch questions. Global collaboration and megatrials with the development of\nsurrogate endpoints and the emphasis on quality of life may prove to be as\nimportant as the sacred overall survival endpoint.\n\nPMID: 9610558  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In this\nstudy, epirubicin (EpiADM) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were given to\nadvanced prostatic cancer patients with symptomatic bone involvement who had\nprogressed to hormonal therapy. EpiADM was administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2\ni.v. weekly and MPA at a daily dose of 1,000 mg p.o. for the first month and 500 \nmg thereafter. Fifty-four patients entered the trial, all of whom were evaluable.\nAmelioration of pain and a > or = 50% reduction in analgesic intake were observed\nin 52% of cases, with a mean duration of 4 months. Of the 28 responsive patients,\n26 had already received two lines of hormonal therapy or were resistant to\nfirst-line therapy. Of the 23 patients with measurable lesions, 6 obtained a > or\n= 50% tumor shrinkage at these sites. The treatment was well tolerated, and no\ncardiac toxicity was observed up to a total cumulative EpiADM dose of 660 mg/m2. \nIn conclusion, this regimen seems to have a palliative effect in patients with\nadvanced prostatic cancer who have progressed to hormonal therapy, and it is\nfeasible in an outpatient setting.\n\nPMID: 7538260  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The\naddition of epirubicin to MAB in such patients seems to improve the therapeutic\nresults further. The beneficial effect of combining castration with epirubicin in\nmetastatic cases appears questionable. In comparing the time to progression in\npatients treated with MAB +/- epirubicin versus castration +/- epirubicin or\nestramustine, many studies reveal similar figures. Whether the results after\ntreatment are actually improved remains controversial. In hormone-refractory\ncases, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) alone seems superior to estramustine or \nprednisolone treatment. Combining MPA and epirubicin improves the results, but\neven if the improvement is of clinical value, it is nonetheless of limited\nmagnitude.\n\nPMID: 7994797  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\ntreatment was discontinued because of side effects in 3 of 51 evaluable\nMPA-treated patients and in 8 of 51 evaluable estramustine-treated patients.\nProgression-free survival was short in both groups and no statistically\nsignificant difference between them was observed. After 1 year, 70% of the\npatients had died and there was no statistically significant difference between\nthe 2 treatments in the cumulative observed survival rates. According to modified\nSPCG criteria, remissions lasting from 12 to 56 weeks were noted in 13\nMPA-treated patients and in 4 estramustine-treated patients.

The median time to treatment failure was also significantly longer for\npatients treated with AG + HC. These findings suggest a role for AG in the\ntreatment of advanced prostate cancer. While both second-line hormone treatment\nregimens resulted in significant suppression of adrenal androgen secretion, the\ndifferences in response rate could not be explained by alterations in peripheral \nblood hormone levels.

Initial treatment was \nwith either diethylstilboestrol (DES) or orchidectomy. Response to DES (5/63,\n81%) was significantly higher than for orchidectomy (18/29, 62%; p less than\n0.01). However, duration of response and duration of survival were not\nsignificantly different for the 2 forms of hormonal therapy. Fifty-seven patients\nwere randomised to receive second-line treatment with either medroxyprogesterone \nacetate (MPA), oral chlorambucil or combination chemotherapy (adriamycin +\ncyclophosphamide + 5-fluoro-uracil). Response to second-line treatment was\nsimilar for all 3 regimens (46% overall response). Most of the responses were\ndisease stabilisation and, although there was symptomatic benefit, response to\nsecond-line therapy did not significantly improve survival compared to the\nsurvival experience of the group as a whole. It is concluded that palliative\nsecond-line treatment for advanced prostatic cancer should consist of the least\ntoxic form of treatment which in this study was second-line hormone\nadministration (MPA).\n\nPMID: 2528705  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In a\nmulticentric study, we have studied the effectiveness of buserelin in patients\nwith previously untreated histologically confirmed metastatic prostate cancer.\nFifty-eight patients were enrolled in the study and are now followed for at least\n12 months. The treatment consisted of 500 micrograms buserelin administered\nsubcutaneously (s.c.) 3 times daily for the first seven days and thereafter a\nthrice-daily dose of 400 micrograms buserelin administered intranasally (i.n.). A\ncontinuous reduction of testosterone to castrate levels could be obtained in all \npatients. The following objective responses were seen during the 12 months study \nperiod: 5 patients (8.6%) achieved complete regression after 3-10 months (mean\n6.4 m); 24 patients (41.4%) achieved partial regression after 1-12 months (mean\n4.5 m); 7 patients (12%) remained stable throughout the study; 22 patients\n(32.3%) developed progression after 2-12 months (mean 7.2 m). Toxicity was\nminimal. Only one patient dropped out of the study because of side effects. These\nresults are comparable with results of other forms of hormonal treatment of\nprostate cancer. Long-term results of 3 EORTC GU group comparative studies in\nmetastatic prostate cancer are now available. The first study, 30761, compared\ncyproterone acetate, medroxy-progesterone acetate, and DES. No differences\nbetween the 3 treatment arms were observed except for medroxy-progesterone\nacetate, which showed less therapeutic effect in the dosage used. Protocol 30762 \ncompared DES and estramustine phosphate. No significant difference in objective\nresponse and survival was noted. Protocol 30805 studied a comparison between\norchiectomy alone and orchiectomy supplemented by cyproterone acetate and DES.\nAgain no statistically significant difference was found between the three\ntherapeutic arms.\n\nPMID: 2968760  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

All 25 patients were followed until time of death and all were able\nto receive hormonal therapy. We did not find substantially improved response\nrates when combination chemotherapy was applied before endocrine treatment since \nthe 33% objective response rate to chemotherapy was only minimally higher than\nthe response in our patients who had failed hormonal therapy and then received\nidentical or similar chemotherapy. Furthermore, the introduction of intensive\ncombination chemotherapy before hormonal therapy in our study did not result in\nany striking improvement in overall survival compared with patients who received \ninitial hormonal therapy in many other studies. Responses to chemotherapy were\nnot attributable to suppression of serum testosterone since all 12 patients with \npartial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) and four of seven patients with no\nresponse (NR) had normal testosterone levels at the time of response assessment. \nThe initial use of chemotherapy did not adversely affect the expected high\npercentage of objective responses (68%) to subsequent hormonal manipulation. The \nfrequency, duration, and quality of responses to hormonal therapy exceeded the\nresponses to chemotherapy. The disappointing responses to chemotherapy reflect\nthe very modest efficacy of even aggressively delivered cytotoxic agents.\n\nPMID: 2943877  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of 236 patients entered 210 were eligible: 75 received cyproterone\nacetate, 71 medroxyprogesterone acetate and 64 diethylstilbestrol. Local and\ndistant tumor response, time to progression, survival and toxicity were assessed.\nPatients treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate had a less favorable course\nwith a shorter duration of survival and time to progression than those treated\nwith the other 2 drugs. There was no significant difference between\ndiethylstilbestrol and cyproterone acetate. Cardiovascular side effects were\nreported more often in patients treated with diethylstilbestrol than in those\ntreated with cyproterone acetate but severe and lethal cardiovascular toxicity\nwas relatively low in all groups. Other side effects were negligible. Further\nstudies are required to establish the influence of effective hormonal treatment\nupon survival.\n\nPMID: 2942707  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Chemioterapia. 1986 Jun;5(3):164-72.\n\nAn overview of clinical trials with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(HD-MPA) in endocrine-related tumors other than breast cancer.\n\nRobustelli della Cuna G, Zanon P, Pavesi L, Preti P, Prada GA, Decensi A.\n\nHigh-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA) has been successfully employed in \nthe treatment of hormone-related tumors, especially advanced breast cancer.\nHowever, progestins in general and MPA in particular are considered a useful\ntreatment also in other types of tumors such as endometrial, prostatic and renal \ncancer. Furthermore, MPA has been evaluated in tumors which are not classically\nconsidered hormone-related, such as ovarian cancer. Therapy with one of a number \nof progestational agents has been the conventional approach to the management of \nendometrial carcinoma not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy. Among the\nvarious synthetic progestins, MPA has been the most widely employed both by i.m. \nand oral routes, according to a variety of doses and schedules. Objective\nresponses have been obtained in a percentage of women varying between 30 and 50% \nin the different series. While the role of MPA in the palliative treatment of\nadvanced disease is well accepted, opinion is divided on the role of progestins\nin the adjuvant setting. On the basis of available data, it should be concluded\nthat the usefulness of adjuvant therapy with progestins in high risk, early-stage\nendometrial cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated. As far as prostatic\ncancer is concerned, data coming from comparative trials show that MPA is less\neffective than diethylstilbestrol (DES), and therefore should not be considered\nthe first choice for previously untreated patients. However, it can achieve\nresponses in patients who no longer respond or who are refractory to DES, and\nrepresents the treatment of choice for those patients who, due to their\ncardiovascular conditions, cannot be given estrogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250\nWORDS)\n\nPMID: 2941173  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Trial 30761 compared 1 mg.\ndiethylstilbestrol orally 3 times daily to 250 mg. oral cyproterone acetate daily\nand to 500 mg. medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly 3 times weekly for 8\nweeks, then 200 mg. orally daily. Trial 30762 compared 3 mg. diethylstilbestrol\nto 560 mg. estramustine phosphate orally for 8 weeks and then 280 mg. daily. The \n239 patients in study 30761 and 226 in study 30762 were evaluated for\ncardiovascular toxicity during treatment. Various types of side effects (fluid\nretention, hypertension, electrocardiographic changes, myocardial infarction and \nthromboembolic disease) and their degrees of severity were analyzed. In both\nstudies the most frequent type of cardiovascular toxicity was represented by\nfluid retention. Cardiovascular toxicity as a whole was higher with\ndiethylstilbestrol than with estramustine phosphate or medroxyprogesterone\nacetate therapy, and was the lowest with cyproterone acetate therapy. The risk of\nsevere cardiovascular complications developing was the highest during the first 6\nmonths of treatment. Increasing age, body weight greater than 75 kg. and,\nespecially, the presence of previous cardiovascular disease represented adverse\nfactors in the development of cardiovascular toxicity.\n\nPMID: 2935644  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In three phase II studies, adriamycin,\nprocarbazine, vindesine, and mitomycin C have been studied. Two of the three\nprotocols have been completed. In three phase III studies, 3 mg of\ndiethylstilbestrol (DES) is compared to cyproterone acetate (CPA),\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), and Estramustin phosphate (Estracyt). These\ntwo protocols have been closed to entry. The current protocol compares DES, 1 mg,\nto castration and to cyproterone acetate plus castration. From the phase II\nstudies, no drug has emerged that is recommended for treatment of\nhormone-resistant prostatic cancer. The endocrine protocols, designed for the\nprimary treatment of T3, T4, and M1 carcinoma of the prostate, have resulted in\nseveral important observations. Responses to DES, 3 mg/day, and to Estracyt were \nvery similar and amounted to 25-30%. There was somewhat less objective response\nin the CPA and significantly less (P = 0.005) in the MPA group. It has become\nevident that DES at a dosage of 3 mg/day carries a significantly higher risk of\noverall cardiovascular toxicity than does cyproterone acetate, but severe\ncardiovascular complications did not differ between treatment groups. Up to now, \nno differences in survival were observed within the different treatment groups.\nGrade, local tumor extension, and performance were found to have a significant\nimpact on survival.\n\nPMID: 6231535  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Plasminogen levels generally were increased significantly with the\nestrogens but were unchanged following placebo or Provera treatment. Pretreatment\nplasminogen levels in Study 3 were significantly lower (p less than .001) than in\nStudy 2. Plasminogen pretreatment levels were significantly correlated with age, \nhemoglobin, body weight, and blood pressure. Fibrinogen pretreatment levels were \nsignificantly elevated above normal. They were not significantly with age,\nhemoglobin, body weight, or blood pressure. Fibrinogen levels generally were\nsignificantly decreased by the estrogens. Comparisons of means of pretreatment\nfibrinogen and plasminogen levels from patients dying during the first year of\nthe study with the mean pretreatment levels of the patient group alive after 1\nyear on study yielded no significant differences. Death rates were calculated by \npretreatment plasminogen or fibrinogen for all treatments of all Stage III and\nStage IV patients combined for Study 2 and Study 3 separately. Such rates were\ncalculated for all causes combined and for deaths from prostatic cancer or\ncardiovascular disease separately. The levels of plasminogen were significnatly\nnegatively correlated with death rate from all causes combined and with\ncardiovascular disease considered separately, but not with death from prostatic\ncancer. The levels of fibrinogen were signigicantly positively correlated with\ndeath rates from all cuses and nearly significantly with prostatic cancer, but\nnot cardiovascular disease.

S'\n1. Cancer. 1976 Sep;38(3):1095-107.\n\nResponse of serum cholesterol and triglycerides to hormone treatment and the\nrelation of pretreatment values to mortality in patients with prostatic cancer.\n\nSeal US, Doe RP, Byar DP, Corle DK.\n\nCholesterol and triglycerides were measured in plasma samples from patient with\ncancer of the prostate before and after 3 months treatment with either Premarin, \nProvera, Provera and diethylstilbestrol, or diethylstilbestrol alone. Cholesterol\nwas also measured before and after one of three doses of diethylstilbestrol or\nplacebo. Pretreatment cholesterol levels at 196 +/- 1.3 mg per 100 ml (X +/- SE, \nN = 1093) were significantly lower than these reported for similar age group\nnoncancer controls. Significant increases occurred with some of the estrogen\ntreatments. Pretreatment cholesterol levels showed a significant negative\ncorrelation with age in Stage III and IV patients of both studies and a positive \ncorrelation with hemoglobin in Stage III patients of both studies. Pretreatment\ntriglyceride levels at 120 +/- 1.9 mg per 100 ml (X +/- SE, N = 1089) were\nsimilar to levels reported for noncancer controls of similar age. Estrogen\ntreatment produced a significant increase in triglyceride levels. Serum\ntriglycerides were significantly correlated with hemoglobin, weight, and\ncholesterol and negatively correlated with age, Analysis of covariance for both\ncholesterol and triglycerides showed highly significant treatment effects, but no\nstage effects and no stage-treatment interactions. It showed that the\npretreatment value is of extreme importance for predicting or explaining the\n3-month value. Death rates were calculated by level of pretreatment cholesterol\nor pretreatment triglycerides for all Stage II and IV patients, all treatments\ncombined, and for Study 2 and Study 3 separately. No consistent trends were\nevident for cholesterol. Spearman correlation coefficients between category of\ninitial triglyceride value and rank of death rate were computed to test for a\nquadratic effect. When the absolute values of the initial triglyceride values\nminus the overall mean were correlated with the death rate, a significant\nnegative correlation was found for all causes of death and for deaths due to\ncardiovascular disease and prostatic cancer. These results indicate that the\ndeath rate is highest near the overal mean for initial triglyceride values and\ndecreases as the initial values deviate above or below the mean. Initial\ntriglyceride levels appear to have potential as indicators of risk of death in\npatients with prostatic cancer. The percentage of patients dead at 1 year by\ninitial triglyceride levels, measured only in Study 3, revealed a pattern similar\nto that observed for the death rate, that is, the highest percentages were\nassociated with values near the overall mean.\n\nPMID: 182347  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This trial was a 3-year, multicenter, randomized,\ndouble-masked, placebo-controlled trial of four groups taking estrogen or\nestrogen/progestin combinations. A total of 1804 follow-up biopsies were\nperformed in 596 subjects. Relative sensitivity and relative specificity using\nthe diagnosis from the central pathologist as the gold standard and overall\nagreement are presented. Almost 90% of the diagnoses were reported normal by both\nreaders. There were significant differences in agreement among clinics and\ntreatment arms (p < 0.0001). The visit at which the biopsy specimen was obtained,\nage at baseline, prior postmenopausal estrogen use, parity, and drug adherence\nwere not associated with agreement between the two readers. Higher proportions of\ndisagreement were seen in two clinics (13% and 11%) compared with the other five \nclinics (2%-5%). Biopsy specimens from participants who were taking conjugated\nequine estrogens (CEE) only were more likely to be diagnosed differently by both \nreaders (11%) than biopsy specimens from women taking a placebo (2%) or CEE\ncombined with progestins (5%). Relative specificity varied from 86.4% to 98.9%\namong the clinics (p < 0.0001). Relative sensitivity was based on a small number \nof diagnoses, as few biopsy specimens were classified abnormal by the central\npathologist. In patients assigned to CEE combined with progestin, 5 of the 7\nbiopsy specimens that were recorded abnormal by the central pathologist received \na normal diagnosis locally. Our findings show that sample size requirements for\nstudy designs in which a central reader is used can be at least threefold lower\nthan the requirements for designs relying on local diagnoses. Centralized\nprotocols for endometrial histopathology reading and staff training are highly\ndesirable in multicenter trials.\n\nPMID: 9611701  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However,\nsleep and gender may influence therapeutic responses. We investigated the effects\nof a 2-week medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy on sleep and nocturnal\nbreathing in postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: A single-blind placebo-controlled trial was performed in 15\npostmenopausal women with moderate to severe COPD. A 12-week trial included\n2-week treatment periods with placebo and MPA (60 mg/d/14 days). All patients\nunderwent a polysomnography with monitoring of SaO2 and transcutaneous PCO2\n(tcCO2) at baseline, with placebo, with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 60\nmg/d/14 days), and three and six weeks after cessation of MPA.\nRESULTS: Thirteen patients completed the trial. At baseline, the average +/- SD\nof SaO2 mean was 90.6 +/- 3.2 % and the median of SaO2 nadir 84.8 %\n(interquartile range, IQR 6.1). MPA improved them by 1.7 +/- 1.6 %-units (95 %\nconfidence interval (CI) 0.56, 2.8) and by 3.9 %-units (IQR 4.9; 95% CI 0.24,\n10.2), respectively. The average of tcCO2 median was 6.0 +/- 0.9 kPa and\ndecreased with MPA by 0.9 +/- 0.5 kPa (95% CI -1.3, -0.54). MPA improved SaO2\nnadir and tcCO2 median also during REM sleep. Three weeks after cessation of MPA,\nthe SaO2 mean remained 1.4 +/- 1.8 %-units higher than at baseline, the\ndifference being not significant (95% CI -0.03, 2.8). SaO2 nadir was 2.7 %-units \n(IQR 4.9; 95% CI 0.06, 18.7) higher than at baseline. Increases in SaO2 mean and \nSaO2 nadir during sleep with MPA were inversely associated with baseline SaO2\nmean (r = -0.70, p = 0.032) and baseline SaO2 nadir (r = -0.77, p = 0.008),\nrespectively. Treatment response in SaO2 mean, SaO2 nadir and tcCO2 levels did\nnot associate with pack-years smoked, age, BMI, spirometric results or sleep\nvariables.\nCONCLUSION: MPA-induced respiratory improvement in postmenopausal women seems to \nbe consistent and prolonged. The improvement was greater in patients with lower\nbaseline SaO2 values. Long-term studies in females are warranted.\n\nPMCID: PMC1079947\nPMID: 15807890  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A study by the Italian Trials in Medical Oncology Group.\n\nDi Leo A(1), Bajetta E, Buzzoni R, Bochicchio AM, Nol\xc3\xa8 F, Biganzoli L, D'Aprile\nM, Veltri E, Comella G, Aitini E, et al.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Medical Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei\nTumori, Milan, Italy.\n\nThe evaluation of drug efficacy in patients with advanced prostatic cancer who\nhave progressed to hormonal therapy is difficult, although palliation of the pain\nrelated to bone involvement still represents an important endpoint. In this\nstudy, epirubicin (EpiADM) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were given to\nadvanced prostatic cancer patients with symptomatic bone involvement who had\nprogressed to hormonal therapy. EpiADM was administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2\ni.v. weekly and MPA at a daily dose of 1,000 mg p.o. for the first month and 500 \nmg thereafter. Fifty-four patients entered the trial, all of whom were evaluable.\nAmelioration of pain and a > or = 50% reduction in analgesic intake were observed\nin 52% of cases, with a mean duration of 4 months. Of the 28 responsive patients,\n26 had already received two lines of hormonal therapy or were resistant to\nfirst-line therapy. Of the 23 patients with measurable lesions, 6 obtained a > or\n= 50% tumor shrinkage at these sites. The treatment was well tolerated, and no\ncardiac toxicity was observed up to a total cumulative EpiADM dose of 660 mg/m2. \nIn conclusion, this regimen seems to have a palliative effect in patients with\nadvanced prostatic cancer who have progressed to hormonal therapy, and it is\nfeasible in an outpatient setting.\n\nPMID: 7538260  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Hormone\nreplacement therapy (HRT) is effective in preventing bone loss but has not been\nevaluated in randomized trials in PBC. The primary aim was to study the effect of\ntransdermal HRT in combination with daily vitamin D and calcium supplementation\non bone loss compared with vitamin D and calcium supplementation only in\npostmenopausal women with PBC. The secondary aim was to study the safety of\ntransdermal HRT.\nSUBJECTS/INTERVENTIONS: Eighteen females with PBC were randomized to receive 2\nyears therapy with either (i) transdermal oestradiol 50 microg 24 h(-1) two times\nper week + medroxyprogesterone 2.5 mg day(-1) + alfacalcidol 0.25 microg day(-1) \nand calcium 1 g day(-1) or (ii) alfacalcidol 0.25 microg day(-1) and calcium 1 g \nday(-1). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for measurement of bone mineral density\n(BMD) and sampling of blood and serum for measurements of biochemical markers of \nliver function was performed before, during and at the end of treatment.\nRESULTS: BMD increased significantly at the lumbar spine (P < 0.05) and the\nfemoral neck (P < 0.05) in the HRT group whereas no significant change was found \nin the control group. One oestrogen-treated patient was excluded after 1 year\nbecause of deteriorating, but reversible, aminotransferases. Dropout frequency\nbecause of nonliver-related causes was higher in the HRT group. Otherwise, no\ndifference with respect to adverse liver reactions was found between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Transdermal HRT increases BMD in PBC patients with few severe side\neffects related to the liver.\n\nPMID: 15189367  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, the cholestatic potential of estrogen could imply a\nrisk of increased cholestasis in a disease characterized by cholestasis. The aim \nof the present study was to test whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could \nbe used to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in PBC patients with osteoporosis,\nwithout causing deterioration of the liver function.\nMETHODS: Nine female PBC patients with osteoporosis and one with osteopenia were \noffered HRT for two years. The change in BMD was compared to the change in ten\nage-matched female PBC patients who had less severe or no osteopenia and who did \nnot receive HRT. Liver function tests were checked at six-month intervals.\nRESULTS: HRT patients showed a statistically significant increase in lumbar spine\nBMD and total body BMD whereas control patients showed a significant decrease in \nlumbar and total body BMD. In contrast to the controls, HRT patients also showed \na decrease in truncal fat (-3.8%). Neither of the groups showed any statistically\nsignificant changes in the liver function tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: HRT is safe and effective in female PBC patients with osteoporosis.\n\nPMID: 10395037  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nindividual serum IRPH, GGT, and Pro(III)-N-P concentrations exceeded the upper\nnormal limit in most patients. No significant changes were found in any of these \nthree serum markers during any of the five different periods, nor was there any\nevidence for a decrease in the raised prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in the\nhepatic biopsy specimens in response to any of the treatments.\nGalactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase activity decreased significantly in\nthese specimens during medroxyprogesterone therapy, but the interpretation of\nthis, the only positive change, remains unclear. The data suggest that\nD-penicillamine or medroxyprogesterone therapy may have no favourable effect on\nthe increased hepatic collagen formation involved in primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\nPMCID: PMC1420175\nPMID: 6852623  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We evaluated treatment efficacy and fertility\noutcomes in this population.\nMETHODS: Women <45 y treated with oral progestin for CAH or G1EC were identified \nfrom two cancer centers. Data were obtained from medical records and telephone\nquestionnaires. Time until complete response (CR), and from CR until recurrence\nwas censored for patients without events and analyzed for associations with\npatient and treatment characteristics; cumulative incidence functions were used\nto estimate event probability over time.\nRESULTS: 44 patients were identified, 19 (43%) with CAH and 25 (57%) with G1EC.\nMedian age was 36.5 y (26-44). 24 (55%) achieved CR (median time: 5.7 months).\nOlder age was associated with a lower likelihood of CR (HR 0.84, p=0.0003, 95%\nCI, 0.8-0.9). CR probability appeared to plateau after 12 months of therapy.\nAmong those with CR, 13 (54%) recurred (median time 3.5 y). 24 patients (55%)\nunderwent hysterectomy; 3 (13%) were upstaged. 11 (25%) underwent fertility\ntreatment with the following outcomes: 6 (55%) no pregnancy, 2 (18%) at least one\nlive infant, and 3 (27%) spontaneous abortion. One achieved a live birth without \nintervention.\nCONCLUSION: Oral progestin is an effective temporizing fertility-sparing\ntreatment for women with CAH/G1EC. Fertility specialist involvement is\nrecommended due to the low live birth rate without intervention. Progestin\ntherapy should be re-evaluated at 1 year in non-responders due to a low\nprobability of success. Hysterectomy is recommended after childbearing due to a\nhigh recurrence rate.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nPMID: 24561246  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Women with prior hysterectomy received CEE alone (0.625 mg/d)\n(n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895310) or placebo (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895429). The intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years\nin CEE plus MPA trial and 7.2 years in CEE alone trial with 13 years of\ncumulative follow-up until September 30, 2010.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were coronary\nheart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer, respectively. A global index also\nincluded stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip\nfracture, and death.\nRESULTS: During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases\nwere 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI,\n0.95-1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24;\n95% CI, 1.01-1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism,\ndementia (in women aged \xe2\x89\xa565 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary\nincontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor \nsymptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some\nelevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases \nfor CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11-1.48]). The risks and\nbenefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases \nfor CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14) and 104 vs\n135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02);\ncumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer\ndiagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar \nto CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone,\nyounger women (aged 50-59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause\nmortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89.05 for trend\nby age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per\n10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of\n50-59 years to 38 for ages of 70-79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19\nfewer cases for ages of 50-59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70-79 years.\nQuality-of-life outcomes had mixed results in both trials.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Menopausal hormone therapy has a complex pattern of\nrisks and benefits. Findings from the intervention and extended postintervention \nfollow-up of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trials do not support use of this therapy \nfor chronic disease prevention, although it is appropriate for symptom management\nin some women.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMCID: PMC3963523 [Available on 2014/10/2]\nPMID: 24084921  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Follow-up was performed\nprimarily with imaging techniques followed by endometrial biopsy when indicated.\nRESULTS: The median age was 30 years (range, 23-40 years). Fourteen patients\n(29.2%) received daily oral megestrol acetate (median dose 160 mg per day, range \n40-240 mg per day) and 34 (70.8%) received daily oral medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(median dose 500 mg per day, range 80-1,000 mg per day). Complete responses were \nobserved for 37 patients (77.1%) after the median treatment duration of 10 months\n(range 3-20 months). Complete response rates were 76.5%, 73.9%, and 87.5% for\npatients with stage IA, grade 2-3 without myometrial invasion (n=17), for\npatients with stage IA, grade 1 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=23), and \nfor patients with stage IA, grade 2-3 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=8),\nrespectively (P=.731).

The molecular\nbasis for endometrial-specific tumorigenesis is unclear. Progestins inhibit\nestrogen-driven proliferation, and epidemiologic studies have shown that\nprogestin-containing oral contraceptives (OCP) reduce the risk of endometrial\ncancer by 50% in women at general population risk. It is unknown whether they are\neffective in women with Lynch syndrome. Asymptomatic women ages 25 to 50 with\nLynch syndrome were randomized to receive the progestin compounds Depo-Provera\n(depo-MPA) or OCP for three months. An endometrial biopsy and transvaginal\nultrasound were conducted before and after treatment. Endometrial proliferation\nwas evaluated as the primary endpoint. Histology and a panel of surrogate\nendpoint biomarkers were evaluated for each endometrial biopsy as secondary\nendpoints. A total of 51 women were enrolled, and 46 completed treatment. Two of \nthe 51 women had complex hyperplasia with atypia at the baseline endometrial\nbiopsy and were excluded from the study. Overall, both depo-MPA and OCP induced a\ndramatic decrease in endometrial epithelial proliferation and microscopic changes\nin the endometrium characteristic of progestin action. Transvaginal ultrasound\nmeasurement of endometrial stripe was not a useful measure of endometrial\nresponse or baseline hyperplasia. These results show that women with Lynch\nsyndrome do show an endometrial response to short-term exogenous progestins,\nsuggesting that OCP and depo-MPA may be reasonable chemopreventive agents in this\nhigh-risk patient population.\n\nPMCID: PMC3737517\nPMID: 23639481  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Frederic.amant@uz.kuleuven.ac.be\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the therapeutic importance of surgical\ncastration, adjuvant hormonal treatment and lymphadenectomy in endometrial\nstromal sarcoma (ESS). A retrospective and multicentric search was performed.\nClinicopathologic data were retrieved from cases that were confirmed to be ESS\nafter central pathology review. The protocol was approved by the Ethical\nCommittee. ESS was confirmed histopathologically in 34 women, but follow-up data \nwere available in only 31 women. Surgical treatment (n=31) included hysterectomy \nwith or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) in 23 out of 31 (74%) and 8\nout of 31 (26%) cases, respectively. Debulking surgery was performed in 6 out of \n31 cases (19%). Stage distribution was as follows: 22 stage I, 4 stage III and 5 \nstage IV. Women with stage I disease recurred in 4 out of 22 (18%) cases. Among\nstage I women undergoing hormonal treatment with or without BSO, 3 out of 15\n(20%) and 1 out of 7 (14%) relapsed, respectively. Among stages III-IV women\nreceiving adjuvant hormonal treatment or not, 1 out of 5 (20%) and 3 out of 4\n(75%) relapsed, respectively (differences=55.0%, 95% CI=-6.8-81.2%). Kaplan-Meier\ncurves show comparable recurrence rates for stage I disease without adjuvant\nhormonal treatment when compared to stages III-IV disease treated with surgery\nand adjuvant hormonal treatment. Furthermore, women taking hormones at diagnosis \nhave a better outcome when compared to women not taking hormonal treatment. Three\nout of 31 (9%) patients had a systematic lymphadenectomy whereas 3 out of 31 (9%)\nhad a lymph node sampling. In one case, obvious nodal disease was encountered at \npresentation. Isolated retroperitoneal recurrence occurred in 1 out of 31 (3%) of\nall cases and in 1 out of 8 (13%) recurrences. This single woman later also\ndeveloped lung and abdominal metastases. Leaving lymph nodes in situ does not\nappear to alter the clinical outcome of ESS. Although numbers are low, the\nretrospective data suggest that the need for surgical castration (BSO) in\npremenopausal women with early-stage disease should be discussed with the patient\non an individual basis. The data support the current practice in some centres to \nadminister adjuvant hormonal treatment.\n\nPMCID: PMC2360466\nPMID: 17895898  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Twenty-eight patients having EC at presumed stage IA and\n17 patients with AH at younger than 40 years of age were enrolled. All patients\nwere given a daily oral dose of 600 mg of MPA with low-dose aspirin. This\ntreatment continued for 26 weeks, as long as the patients responded. Histologic\nchange of endometrial tissue was assessed at 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. Either \nestrogen-progestin therapy or fertility treatment was provided for the responders\nafter MPA therapy. The primary end point was a pathologic complete response (CR) \nrate. Toxicity, pregnancy rate, and progression-free interval were secondary end \npoints.\nRESULTS: CR was found in 55% of EC cases and 82% of AH cases. The overall CR rate\nwas 67%. Neither therapeutic death nor irreversible toxicities were observed;\nhowever, two patients had grade 3 body weight gain, and one patient had grade 3\nliver dysfunction. During the 3-year follow-up period, 12 pregnancies and seven\nnormal deliveries were achieved after MPA therapy. Fourteen recurrences were\nfound in 30 patients (47%) between 7 and 36 months.\nCONCLUSION: The efficacy of fertility-sparing treatment with a high-dose of MPA\nfor EC and AH was proven by this prospective trial. Even in responders, however, \nclose follow-up is required because of the substantial rate of recurrence.\n\nPMID: 17602085  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A\npretreatment tumor biopsy was obtained and subjected to immunohistochemical\nanalyses. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and progesterone receptor (PR) were \nassessed on frozen tissues, and PR isoforms A and B were detected on fixed\ntissues. The receptors were scored using a semi-quantitative HSCORE, with a cut\noff greater than 75 considered positive.\nRESULTS: Of the 60 eligible patients, 45 had evaluable tissues for all receptors.\nFor ER, 40% of the cases were positive; for PR, 45% were positive. The\nsub-cellular distribution of PRA was exclusively nuclear, and 16% of the tumors\ndemonstrated positive staining. PRB was nuclear and cytoplasmic, with 22% of the \ntumors staining for nuclear PRB and 36% of the tumors staining for cytoplasmic\nPRB. ER and PR from frozen tissues and PRA and cytoplasmic PRB from fixed tissues\nsignificantly decreased with increasing tumor grade. The co-expression of\nER-alpha with PR from the frozen tissues (r=0.68, p<0.001) and PRA (r=0.58,\np<0.001) from the fixed tissues was statistically significant. The ER HSCORE was \nrelated to both response and overall survival; there was no statistically\nsignificant correlation of PR with clinical response in this small number of\npatients.\nCONCLUSION: ER-alpha measured in metastatic endometrial carcinoma tissue prior to\nhormonal therapy was statistically significantly related to clinical response to \ndaily tamoxifen and intermittent medroxyprogesterone acetate.\n\nPMID: 17532033  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Tibolone was compared with continuous combined\nconjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (0.625 + \n2.5 mg/d).\nMETHODS: Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to tibolone 1.25 mg/d, 2.5\nmg/d, and CEE/MPA, respectively. The one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) has\nbeen evaluated for the incidence of abnormal endometrial histology (hyperplasia\nor carcinoma) and hyperplasia and carcinoma separately for each of the two\ntreatment groups and the treatment groups combined after 1 and 2 yr of treatment \nwith tibolone, compared with CEE/MPA.\nRESULTS: A total of 3240 women were randomized, with 3224 receiving at least one \ndose of study medication. The incidence and upper one-sided 95% CI for the\nincidence of abnormal endometrium (hyperplasia or carcinoma), and hyperplasia and\ncarcinoma separately, were calculated at end point, yr 1, and yr 2. The incidence\n(upper one-sided 95% CI) of abnormal endometrium at end point was 0.0 (0.5), 0.0 \n(0.4), and 0.2 (0.5) in the tibolone 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and CEE/MPA groups,\nrespectively. During the entire treatment period, amenorrhea was reported more\nfrequently with tibolone 1.25 mg (78.7%) and 2.5 mg (71.4%) than CEE/MPA (44.9%).\nCONCLUSION: The Tibolone Histology of the Endometrium and Breast Endpoints Study \nresults confirm previous findings that tibolone does not induce endometrial\nhyperplasia or carcinoma in postmenopausal women, and it is associated with a\nbetter vaginal bleeding profile than CEE/MPA.\n\nPMID: 17192288  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

For the last six months, all received the 1 +\n2.5 dosage. The 2 + 2.5 dosage was discontinued at the end of year 7. A total of \n198 women continued after year 7.\nRESULTS: Annualized percentage rates for cardiovascular events [corrected] and\nendometrial cancers [corrected] were below national rates for Finland and those\nreported for the Women's Health Initiative. There were no serious events with the\n1 + 2.5 dosage or after ccHRT discontinuation. Climacteric symptoms remained\nsignificantly below baseline values after dosage reduction; some symptoms\nrecurred after discontinuation of ccHRT. HRQOL ratings improved with ccHRT,\nirrespective of dosage, including depressed mood, anxiety, health perception and \nsexual interest. Scores on a scale assessing daily functioning and enjoyment\n(Q-LES-Q) improved from year 7 to year 9. They deteriorated during follow-up in\nwomen not continuing ccHRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower dosages of HRT were as effective as higher doses in improving \nclimacteric symptoms and HRQOL ratings and had fewer safety concerns. Following\ndiscontinuation of ccHRT, patient satisfaction was variable, with 15% electing to\ncontinue or restart HRT and 7% resuming at follow-up. This supports the need for \nan individualized approach to therapy recommendations.\n\nPMID: 16953985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Immunohistochemical expression in tissue\nspecimens for Bcl-2 and BAX was evaluated by H-score. Average number of apoptotic\ncells per hundred cells within ten different high power field (40 x) was\nevaluated for each section after in situ apoptosis detection (TUNEL method). A\nsecond group of patients with endometrial hyperplasia was examined after 1 week\ntreatment with levonorgestrel IUD (n = 6) or medroxyprogesterone (n = 5) to\ndetermine early effects on expression of Bcl-2 and BAX and the extent of\napoptosis.\nRESULTS: All the patients in the IUD group (n = 31) but only about half of the\npatients in per oral group (16 of 26) responded to treatment. The glandular\nreduction in Bcl-2 expression was markedly greater for the IUD patients than for \nthe patients who received oral gestagen. The decrease in BAX expression after IUD\ntreatment was less than the reduction of Bcl-2. Decrease in glandular Bcl-2 after\n3 months of treatment was coincident with a significant increase in the\nmeasurable amount of apoptosis. In stromal cells, the increase in expression of\nBcl-2 and BAX was found after gestagen treatment, the response being much more\nmarked for the IUD group. The non- responders to per oral gestagen had no Bcl-2\nexpression in stroma after 3 months of therapy whereas an increase was observed\nfor the responders. After 1 week, glandular Bcl-2 expression was significantly\nreduced after treatment in the IUD group. As for the rest, no changes were\ndetected in either of the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that proteins in the apoptotic cascade are\nregulated by gestagen therapy in human endometrial precancers. Expression of\nthese proteins is shown to be dependent on administration form and/or type of\ngestagen. Stromal Bcl-2 expression appears to be a potential biomarker which can \nseparate responders of gestagen treatment from non-responders after oral\nadministration.\n\nPMID: 15885761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The hazard\nratio (HR) for invasive ovarian cancer in women assigned to estrogen plus\nprogestin compared with placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI],\n0.77-3.24). The HR for endometrial cancer was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.48-1.36). No\nappreciable differences were found in the distributions of tumor histology,\nstage, or grade for either cancer site. The incidence of other gynecologic\ncancers was low and did not differ by randomization assignment. More women taking\nestrogen plus progestin required endometrial biopsies (33% vs 6%; P<.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial suggests that continuous combined estrogen\nplus progestin therapy may increase the risk of ovarian cancer while producing\nendometrial cancer rates similar to placebo. The increased burden of endometrial \nbiopsies required to assess vaginal bleeding further limits the acceptability of \nthis regimen. These data provide additional support for caution in the use of\ncontinuous combined hormones.\n\nPMID: 14519708  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A global index summarizing the balance of risks and \nbenefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE),\nendometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other\ncauses.\nRESULTS: On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and\nsafety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin\nvs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the\nstopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic\nsupported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major\nclinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal \n95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286\ncases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85)\nwith 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63\n(0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases;\nhip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes,\n0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for\ncomposite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease\n(arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76\n(0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and\n1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000\nperson-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8\nmore strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk\nreductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer\nhip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index\nwas 19 per 10 000 person-years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen\nplus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US \nwomen. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit\nprofile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable \nintervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate\nthat this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of \nCHD.\n\nPMID: 12117397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Fanarjyan Center for Cancer Research, Ministry of Health of the Republic of \nArmenia, Yerevan.\n\nThe data on clinical trials of newly-developed hormonotherapy of atypical\nhyperplasia (AH) and cervical adenocarcinoma (CAC) are presented. The study\nincluded 34 patients with histologically--confirmed AH and 86--CAC (stage I-II\nand III-IV). All patients were given preoperative "shock therapy" with a\ncombination of progestins and anticoagulants: 500 mg, i.v., 10 days--(AH) and\nwell-differentiated cell CAC; 20 days--moderately- and poorly-differentiated cell\nCAC. Total dose was 5 g and 10 g, respectively. Fibrolysin, pelentan and aspirin \n(antiaggregant of thrombocytes) were used as anticoagulants. For comparison,\nidentical numbers of AH and CAC patients received similar preoperative progestin \ntherapy without anticoagulants. The study was randomized. Hormonal pathomorphosis\nin tumor was identified after surgery and relevant characteristics of bioptical\nand resected material were compared. It was found that hormonotherapy used in\nconjunction with anticoagulants reinforced significantly all features of hormonal\npathomorphosism both in AH and CAC stage I-II while, in well-differentiated cell \nadenocarcinoma, the difference from control was significant (p < 0.05).\n\nPMID: 11544839  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jun;17(6):1736-44.\n\nOral medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of advanced or recurrent\nendometrial carcinoma: a dose-response study by the Gynecologic Oncology Group.\n\nThigpen JT(1), Brady MF, Alvarez RD, Adelson MD, Homesley HD, Manetta A, Soper\nJT, Given FT.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Oncology, University of Mississippi School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, \nUSA.\n\nPURPOSE: Progestins have definite activity against advanced or recurrent\nendometrial carcinoma. Both parenteral and oral progestins yield similar serum\nlevels and response rates, which range from 18% to 34%. The one major study that \nused oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) noted a response rate at the lower\nend of the range (18%) and much poorer progression-free and overall survival\ntimes (4 and 10.5 months, respectively) than previously reported. The present\nstudy sought to confirm this earlier study of oral MPA, to assess the importance \nof prognostic factors such as histologic grade and receptor levels, and to\ndetermine whether a higher dose of MPA would yield a higher response rate.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-nine eligible women with advanced or\nrecurrent endometrial carcinoma were randomized to receive oral MPA either 200\nmg/d or 1, 000 mg/d until unacceptable toxicity intervened or their disease\nprogressed.\nRESULTS: Among 145 patients receiving the low-dose regimen, there were 25\ncomplete (17%) and 11 partial (8%) responses for an overall response rate of 25%.\nThe 154 patients receiving the high-dose regimen experienced 14 (9%) complete and\n10 (6%) partial responses for an overall response rate of 15%. Median durations\nof progression-free survival were 3.2 months and 2.5 months for the low-dose and \nhigh-dose regimens, respectively. Median survival durations were 11.1 months and \n7.0 months, respectively. The adjusted relative odds of responding to the\nhigh-dose regimen compared with the low-dose regimen was 0.61 (90% confidence\ninterval, 0.36 to 1.04). Prognostic factors having a significant impact on the\nprobability of response included initial performance status, age, histologic\ngrade, and progesterone receptor concentration. Compliance with oral therapy was \ndocumented with serum levels 1 month after starting therapy, when possible. MPA\nlevels were commensurate with the assigned dose and schedule.\nCONCLUSION: Oral MPA is active against endometrial carcinoma. Response to\nprogestin therapy is more frequent among patients with a well-differentiated\nhistology and positive progesterone receptor status. This study provides no\nevidence to support the use of MPA 1,000 mg/d orally instead of MPA 200 mg/d\norally. In fact, the trends suggest the opposite. The use of oral MPA 200 mg/d is\na reasonable initial approach to the treatment of advanced or recurrent\nendometrial carcinoma, particularly those lesions that are well-differentiated\nand/or progesterone receptor-positive (> 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein). Patients\nwith poorly differentiated and/or progesterone receptor levels less than 50\nfmol/mg cytosol protein had only an 8% to 9% response rate.\n\nPMID: 10561210  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

None had received prior\nchemotherapy and/or hormonotherapy for metastatic disease. Ten patients had\nreceived radiotherapy. Response to treatment was evaluated every two courses.\nObjective response was seen in 17 of the 23 patients (74%, 95% confidence\ninterval = 52-90%), with 2 long-lasting complete responses (9%). The median\nresponse duration was 10+ months (3-45+). The median survival was 16+ months\n(2-45+). The 2 complete responders, the first in the lung and the second in groin\nnodes, are without evidence or recurrence after 32 and 45 months, respectively.\nThe regimen was given on an outpatient basis and was well tolerated. The major\ntoxic effects were myelosuppression (less than 14% leukopenia, anemia and\nthrombocytopenia). The MPA-related side effects were: weight gain (22%),\nhypertension (17%) and thromboplebitis (17%). In 2 patients, consolidation\ntreatment with MPA was discontinued because of thromboplebitis. In conclusion,\nthe JMF-M regimen is highly active with an acceptable toxicity in patients with\nrecurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma.\n\nPMID: 10202274  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

This trial was a 3-year, multicenter, randomized,\ndouble-masked, placebo-controlled trial of four groups taking estrogen or\nestrogen/progestin combinations. A total of 1804 follow-up biopsies were\nperformed in 596 subjects. Relative sensitivity and relative specificity using\nthe diagnosis from the central pathologist as the gold standard and overall\nagreement are presented. Almost 90% of the diagnoses were reported normal by both\nreaders. There were significant differences in agreement among clinics and\ntreatment arms (p < 0.0001). The visit at which the biopsy specimen was obtained,\nage at baseline, prior postmenopausal estrogen use, parity, and drug adherence\nwere not associated with agreement between the two readers. Higher proportions of\ndisagreement were seen in two clinics (13% and 11%) compared with the other five \nclinics (2%-5%). Biopsy specimens from participants who were taking conjugated\nequine estrogens (CEE) only were more likely to be diagnosed differently by both \nreaders (11%) than biopsy specimens from women taking a placebo (2%) or CEE\ncombined with progestins (5%). Relative specificity varied from 86.4% to 98.9%\namong the clinics (p < 0.0001). Relative sensitivity was based on a small number \nof diagnoses, as few biopsy specimens were classified abnormal by the central\npathologist. In patients assigned to CEE combined with progestin, 5 of the 7\nbiopsy specimens that were recorded abnormal by the central pathologist received \na normal diagnosis locally. Our findings show that sample size requirements for\nstudy designs in which a central reader is used can be at least threefold lower\nthan the requirements for designs relying on local diagnoses. Centralized\nprotocols for endometrial histopathology reading and staff training are highly\ndesirable in multicenter trials.\n\nPMID: 9611701  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Continuous combined HRT using 2.5 mg of\nmedroxyprogesterone was designed to increase patient compliance by eliminating\nwithdrawal bleeding while at the same time retaining the beneficial effects of\nHRT. There are limited long-term data, however, regarding the safety of\ncontinuous combined HRT. Of concern are reports of endometrial carcinoma arising \nin women receiving continuous HRT with low-dose progestin. Eight cases of women\nwho developed endometrial carcinoma while on this regimen are presented. The\npossible increased risk of endometrial cancer associated with this regimen may be\nrelated to inadequate progestin dose, prior use of unopposed estrogen, poor\npatient compliance, use of less effective progestins, less efficient reversal of \nhyperplasia, and the use of progestin continuously.\n\nPMID: 9062144  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Participants administered one of\nthe three E+P regimens had similar rates of hyperplasia as those given placebo (P\n= .16). The occurrence of hyperplasia was distributed evenly across the 3 years\nof the trial. Women taking estrogens alone also had more unscheduled biopsies\n(66.4% vs 8.4%; P < .001) and curettages (17.6% vs 0.8%; P < .001) than women\nreceiving placebo. The number of surgical procedures was similar for women\nreceiving placebo and women receiving the E+P regimens (P = .38). Of the 45 women\nwith complex (adenomatous) or atypical hyperplasia, study medications were\ndiscontinued in all, and the biopsy results of 34 (94%) of 36 women with\nhyperplasia reverted to normal with progestin therapy. The remainder had\ndilatation and curettage (n = 2) or hysterectomy with (n = 2) or without (n = 6) \nprior medical therapy, or refused further biopsies (n = 1). One woman developed\nadenocarcinoma of the endometrium while receiving placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: At a dosage of 0.625 mg, the daily administration of CEE enhanced\nthe development of endometrial hyperplasia. Combining CEE with cyclic or\ncontinuous MPA or cyclic MP protected the endometrium from hyperplastic changes\nassociated with estrogen-only therapy.\n\nPMID: 8569016  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 5 year follow-up of 82 patients after\nhigh-dose gestagen treatment.\n\nLindahl B(1), Will\xc3\xa9n R.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.\n\nEndometrial hyperplasia was proposed as a predecessor to endometrial carcinoma\nalready at the end of the 19th century. However, there have been different\nopinions regarding this view. The treatment also varies, but generally cyclic\nprogesterone at a dose of 10 mg a day is used. In order to investigate whether\nendometrial hyperplasia is a premalignant state and also whether a high-dose\ngestagen treatment would cure a high proportion of these patients, a prospective \nrandomised study was started in 1982. We now present the 5 year follow-up\nconsisting of 82 patients treated with high-dose gestagen. In this study 19 out\nof 82 patients had hysterectomies (2 due to hyperplasia and 11 due to bleeding), \nalmost the same frequency as in a previous report with patients followed-up with \nabrasio only, but now mainly due to bleeding problems. In summary, no carcinoma\ndeveloped and the hyperplasia was cured with 500 mg MPA i.m. twice weekly for\nthree months. However, the bleeding problems, though almost always only spotting,\nremained, leading to a frequency of hysterectomy that was still too high. We find\nlatter clinical problem an enigma. Further studies are therefore in progress in\nour group which try to identify other treatment modalities for those patients\nwith bleeding problems or who redeveloped hyperplasia after abrasio, in order to \navoid hysterectomies.\n\nPMID: 7872726  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A prospective, 5 year follow-up of 246\npatients after abrasio only, including 380 patients followed-up for 2 years.\n\nLindahl B(1), Will\xc3\xa9n R.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.\n\nThe treatment of patients with endometrial hyperplasia differs widely, ranging\nfrom immediate hysterectomy to no treatment or follow-up at all. This is due to\nthe fact that a vital question has not been answered, namely: is endometrial\nhyperplasia a predecessor to carcinoma or not? In order to investigate whether\nendometrial hyperplasia is a premalignant state we have followed up 246 patients \nwith abrasio only for 5 years. We found that there was no higher risk of CGH and \nadenomatous hyperplasia developing into a carcinomatous state than in normal\ncases. We found it possible to follow up these patients with abrasio only as\nscheduled. The very few patients developing carcinoma did so already at the first\ncontrol after 3 months. Among atypical endometrial hyperplasias there was an\nincreased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma. We could divide these\npatients into two groups: one with very severe atypia so close to carcinoma that \nan immediate hysterectomy was recommended. Nine out of 12 had already developed\ncarcinoma at the time of the operation. In another group of 21 patients followed \nwith abrasio only, 2 had developed carcinoma at the first control. This means\nthat among 368 patients with endometrial hyperplasia followed-up with abrasio for\n2 years, 13 were found to have carcinoma. Twelve patients with very severe atypia\nwere recommended to have an operation and 9 were found to have cancer. Among the \nother 356 patients, 4 were found to have cancer at the first control (2 with an\ninitial diagnosis of CGH and 2 with atypical hyperplasia).\n\nPMID: 7840513  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is also not\nuncommon that patients receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) require\nendometrial biopsy in order to evaluate the effects of oestrogens and\nprogestogens on endometrium. However, endometrial biopsy is often associated with\npain and discomfort, and transvaginal sonography has been suggested as a new and \npainless method of monitoring the effects of HRT on the endometrium.\nMETHODS: Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed in a series of women on\nseveral regimens of HRT immediately prior to endometrial biopsy (Cornier\ncannula). We correlated the morphology and thickness of the endometrium as\nassessed by transvaginal ultrasonography with the endometrial histology. Patients\nwere assigned into four groups. The first (n = 15) received 0.6 mg/day of\nconjugated equine oestrogen (CEE) cyclically and the second (n = 6) received 50\nmicrograms/day of transdermal oestradiol cyclically. All these groups also\nreceived 5 mg of medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) sequentially for the last 12 \ndays of HRT, while the third therapy group (n = 7) received 0.625 mg/day of CEE\nand 5 mg/day of MPA uninterruptedly. The fourth group (n = 8) constituted a\ntreatment-free control group. In total 36 biopsies were taken. Our initial\nresults suggest that endometrial thickness under 4 mm measured by ultrasonography\nis not associated with endometrial abnormalities and that transvaginal\nultrasonographic scanning of the endometrium may be a useful tool in determining \nwhich patients require endometrial histologic evaluation and perhaps in detecting\nthose who need adjustment in the progestin dosage.\n\nPMID: 7935033  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After surgery, patients with disease limited\nto the endometrium did not receive any further treatment. Patients with inner\nmyometrial invasion and well or moderate differentiation were randomised to no\nfurther treatment vs. MPA 100 mg orally twice a day for 12 months; patients with \nmoderate or deep myometrial invasion or undifferentiated grade were randomised to\nradiotherapy on pelvis vs. radiotherapy plus MPA, and patients with node-positive\ndisease (N+) were submitted to radiotherapy on pelvis and para-aortic nodes vs.\nradiotherapy plus MPA. At 84 months, analysis as intention to treat on 856\npatients shows a high relapse-free survival, whereas it did not show any\nsignificant difference between the MPA-treated and untreated groups. The study\nindicates that relapse-free survival is influenced by a treatment based on the\npathological extension of the disease and that adjuvant hormonotherapy does not\nimprove the cure rate.\n\nPMID: 8518024  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thirty patients with unresectable HCC were\nrandomly divided into two groups. A catheter was inserted into the hepatic artery\nof all patients. The first group (group A) was administered 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin\n(CDDP) on day 15 and 13 mg/m2 of Adriamycin (ADM) on day 1 and 8 postoperatively \nvia the hepatic artery cannula; in addition, a daily dose of 150 mg\n5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered orally. Tamoxifen (TAM) 25 mg/m2 daily and\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 400 mg/m2 daily were also administered orally. \nTAM and MPA administration were alternated every 4 weeks. For the second group\n(group B) the same protocol of anticancer drugs administration, without the\nhormonal agents, was given. At least three courses of the treatments were carried\nout. Twelve patients in group A and 14 in group B were evaluated. Partial\nresponse of the hepatic tumor to the treatments was observed in 33.3% of group A \npatients and 21.4% of group B patients, a difference that was not statistically\nsignificant. The 1-year survival rate was 44.5% in group A and 33.0% in group B. \nThe performance status of 25% of the patients in group A was significantly\nimproved compared with 14.3% in group B (p < 0.05). TAM- and MPA-combined\nchemotherapy may not prolong the survival of patients with HCC, although it\nimproves their quality of life.\n\nPMID: 8393272  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Outcome measures included memory, subjective cognition, QoL,\nsexuality, and sleep, which were assessed at baseline and month 4.\nRESULTS: The study was terminated before the expected final sample size of 275\ndue to a decrease in enrollment coinciding with the publication of findings from \nthe Women's Health Initiative. There were no differences between groups on any\ncognitive or QoL measures, except for an increase in sexual interest and thoughts\nwith HT. Modest negative effects on short- and long-term verbal memory approached\nsignificance (p < 0.10). Women with baseline vasomotor symptoms (VMS) showed a\ndecrease in VMS and an improvement in general QoL, but no cognitive benefit vs\nplacebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the power to detect an effect size of >or=0.45, this study\nsuggests potential modest negative effects on verbal memory that are consistent\nwith previous hormone therapy trials in older women.\n\nPMID: 17893293  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

No trial has evaluated the effect of\nhormone therapy on diabetes incidence.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hormone therapy on fasting glucose level and\nincident diabetes.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING: 20 U.S. clinical centers.\nPARTICIPANTS: 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease who were\nfollowed for 4.1 years. At baseline, 734 women had diabetes, 218 women had\nimpaired fasting glucose, and 1811 women were normoglycemic; the 2029 women\nwithout diabetes were followed for incident diabetes.\nINTERVENTION: 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone \nacetate daily, or placebo.\nMEASUREMENTS: Fasting glucose level was measured at baseline, at year 1, and at\nthe end of the trial. Incident diabetes was defined by self-report of diabetes or\ndisease complication, fasting glucose level of 6.9 mmol/L or greater (> or =126\nmg/dL), or initiation of therapy with diabetes medication.\nRESULTS: Fasting glucose levels increased significantly among women assigned to\nplacebo but did not change among women receiving hormone therapy. The incidence\nof diabetes was 6.2% in the hormone therapy group and 9.5% in the placebo group\n(relative hazard, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89]; P = 0.006). The number needed to\ntreat for benefit to prevent one case of diabetes was 30 (CI, 18 to 103). Changes\nin weight and waist circumference did not mediate this effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: In women with coronary disease, hormone therapy reduced the\nincidence of diabetes by 35%. This observation provides important insights into\nthe metabolic effects of postmenopausal hormones but is insufficient to recommend\nthe use of hormones for secondary prevention of heart disease.\n\nPMID: 12513038  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

BP responses to\nmental arithmetic were not affected in non-diabetic women. BP responses to\nisometric exercise and to intravenous infusions of noradrenaline and angiotensin \nII were similar in the type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic women and were not\naffected by ERT or HRT therapy. Plasma renin activity differed significantly\nbetween ERT, HRT and placebo therapies in type 2 diabetic women, apparently\nbecause of lower levels during ERT and HRT therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: ERT and HRT may produce beneficial effects on BP responses to\npsychological stress and on plasma renin activity in women with type 2 diabetes. \nBP responses to isometric exercise and to intravenous infusions of noradrenaline \nand angiotensin II are not altered by ERT or HRT in type 2 diabetic or\nnon-diabetic women.\n\nPMID: 12443833  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Study \nvariables were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.\nRESULTS: Eight women randomized to hormone replacement therapy and four women\nassigned to placebo group dropped out of the study. Plasma CRP increased (2.2\nmg/l, 95% confidence interval 0.3-4.1 mg/l) significantly (P = 0.02) in women\ntreated with HRT (n = 21) compared with placebo (n = 29) taking baseline CRP,\nbody mass index (BMI) and smoking status into account. Plasma levels of cell\nadhesion molecules, IL-6 and leucocyte count did not change significantly during \nthe study.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that oral HRT with conjugated equine\noestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate increases plasma CRP levels but not\nnecessarily global inflammatory activity in post-menopausal diabetic women. An\nincrease in plasma CRP may potentially increase risk of a cardiovascular event.\n\nPMID: 12358873  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\noffers any cardiovascular advantage to diabetic postmenopausal women is not\nknown. Diabetic subjects have increased vascular load and abnormal 24-h blood\npressure (BP) profiles. Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to improve\nindexes of arterial load in nondiabetic postmenopausal women as well as to\nrestore circadian variation in BP. This aim of this study, therefore, was to\ndetermine prospectively whether HRT improved arterial stiffness and 24-h\nambulatory BP profile in diabetic postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: Twelve diabetic postmenopausal women were studied. Six subjects were\nalso hypertensive. Vascular load was characterized by carotid arterial pulse\nwaveform analysis to calculate central augmentation index. All subjects also\nunderwent 24-h BP monitoring. Subjects were studied before commencement of HRT\nand were then randomized to two groups. The first group was observed for 6 months\nand then given 2 months of estrogen alone, followed by 4 months of combination\nestrogen with progestin. The second group received the HRT regimen first, then\nwere restudied after 6 months off HRT.\nRESULTS: The HRT did not affect either clinic or ambulatory BP. There were no\nchanges in indexes of vascular load or pulse pressure, an indirect measure of\narterial stiffness. There was a low rate of circadian variation in 24-h BP at\nbaseline (55%), which was unaltered by HRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HRT was well tolerated. Despite evidence for a beneficial effect\nof HRT on indexes of arterial load and ambulatory BP previously reported in\nnormal subjects, we found no change in this cohort of diabetic postmenopausal\nwomen.\n\nPMID: 11465656  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients receiving insulin were excluded from the study and all lipid\nmodifying drugs were ceased at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation. Other\nmedication including oral hypoglycaemics was kept constant for the duration of\nthe study.\nRESULTS: Women with type II diabetes were a similar age (58.7+/-1.3 years) to the\nnon-diabetic women (59.6+/-1.6 years) but they had a significantly greater body\nmass index, a higher incidence of treated hypertension, higher fasting plasma\nglucose levels, higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol levels than\nnon-diabetic women. ERT reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by a\nsimilar extent (8.9-12.3%) in normal and type II diabetic women and increased HDL\ncholesterol to a similar extent in both groups (11.0 and 8.9% respectively). ERT \ndid not significantly alter fasting triglyceride levels in either group. The\naddition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg daily abolished the increase in HDL \ncholesterol associated with ERT in both groups but did not significantly affect\nany of the other lipid measurements. ERT and HRT did not significantly alter\nfasting insulin levels nor alter fasting glucose levels in either non-diabetic\nwomen or women with type II diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS: ERT and HRT have similar effects on lipids in women with type II\ndiabetes and non-diabetic women after 1 month of therapy.\n\nPMID: 10717490  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Measures included anthropometry, fasting glucose,\ninsulin, HbA1c, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, LDL\nparticle size, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), sex hormone-binding globulin,\nresting energy expenditure (REE), total and central abdominal fat (by dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry), resting BP, APWV (by applanation tonometry), physical\nactivity, well-being, and sexual function.\nRESULTS: Six months of HRT resulted in significant reductions in waist-to-hip\nratio (-0.03+/-0.01 vs. 0.01+/-0.009, P = 0.007), HbA1c (-0.34+/-0.24 vs.\n0.6+/-0.4%, P = 0.04), total cholesterol (-0.6+/-0.1 vs. 0.2+/-0.2 mmol/l, P =\n0.001), central abdominal fat (-175+/-51 vs. -24+/-56 g, P = 0.05), and improved \nphysical functioning (P = 0.05), compared with observation. There was a minor\nincrease in REE with HRT (33+/-23 vs. -38+/-23 kJ/day, P = 0.04). Total fat mass,\nfasting glucose, insulin, triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, NEFA, resting BP, APWV,\nand physical activity were unchanged.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal HRT in these overweight women with type 2 diabetes\nwas associated with a reduction in central adiposity and improvement in lipid\nmetabolism and glycemic control without deterioration in weight status or\ncardiovascular parameters measured. Whether HRT-induced improvements in these\ncardiovascular risk factors result in lower long-term cardiovascular morbidity\nand mortality, as observed in nondiabetic women, awaits further study.\n\nPMID: 10480500  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Current cytotoxic chemotherapy\nfurther worsens the problem of reduced haemopoiesis and two-thirds of patients\nare too frail to tolerate intensive chemotherapy at all. Median survival amongst \nthese patients remains at <3 months emphasizing the urgent need for anti-AML\ntherapies that do not suppress haemopoiesis. Our laboratory studies showed\ncombined Bezafibrate and Medroxyprogesterone acetate (BaP) had activity against\nAML without toxicity to normal stem cells. Here we report the safety and efficacy\nof BaP in 20 patients (19 AML, 1 high-risk myelodysplasia) for whom intensive\nchemotherapy was not an option. No patient exhibited haematological toxicity from\nBaP. Eleven patients took BaP alone for >4 weeks. One reverted from high risk\nmyelodysplasia and remains transfusion independent after 201 weeks of therapy.\nThree AML patients gained major haematological improvements for 22-30 weeks; in\none, marrow was available to document a partial AML response. Thus, this trial\nindicates that BaP therapy has potential for treatment of elderly and relapsed\nAML.\n\nPMID: 20067564  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, observational studies regarding menopausal\nhormone therapy use and lung cancer have given mixed results. Some have\nassociated hormone therapy use with increased lung cancer risk, while others have\nshown no effect or found lower lung cancer risk in hormone therapy users. Against\nthis background the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trial\nevaluating conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)\nin postmenopausal women identified an increase in malignancies in the hormone\ntherapy group during the post intervention period. Post hoc analyses identified a\nstatistically significant increase in deaths from lung cancer for women in the\nhormone group largely related to effects on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nThe NSCLCs were more commonly poorly differentiated and were diagnosed at a\nmetastatic stage, suggesting a hormone effect on already established lung cancer \ngrowth. Ongoing preclinical and clinical analyses have identified estrogen\nreceptors in the nucleus and cytoplasm of lung tissue and lung cancers. More\nrecently, intriguing associations among estrogen receptor expression, lung cancer\nhistology, clinical prognosis, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\nmutations have been reported. The WHI clinical findings should be integrated into\nrisk-benefit discussion with women considering combined hormone therapy use. In\naddition, the findings, together with ongoing studies evaluating estrogen\nreceptor status and function, support further efforts to develop lung cancer\nintervention strategies targeting estrogen receptor expression.\n\nPMID: 19995648  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Roffo Cancer Institute, University of Buenos\nAires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nComment in\n    J Pain Symptom Manage. 2004 Sep;28(3):195-7; author reply 197-8.\n\nSystemic syndromes characterized by a persistent activity of circulating\nmediators (cytokines) are frequently present with advanced cancer. We grouped\nunder the general heading of "Systemic Immune-Metabolic Syndrome (SIMS)" a\nparticular variety of distressing systemic syndrome characterized by\ndysregulation of the psycho-neuro-immune-endocrine homeostasis, with overlapping \nclinical manifestations. SIMS may include cachexia, anorexia, nausea, early\nsatiety, fatigue, tumor fever, cognitive changes and superinfection. The aim of\nthis study was to ameliorate some of the SIMS symptoms in a homogeneous group of \nlung adenocarcinoma patients using a multitargeted therapy. Fifteen patients with\nevidence of SIMS were studied. SIMS was defined as the presence of weight loss,\nanorexia, fatigue performance status>/=2 and acute-phase protein response.\nPatients received medroxyprogesterone (MPA) (500 mg twice daily), celecoxib (200 \nmg twice daily), plus oral food supplementation for 6 weeks. After treatment, 13 \npatients either had stable weight (+/- 1%) or had gained weight. There were\nsignificant differences in improvement of body-weight-change rate, nausea, early \nsatiety, fatigue, appetite and performance status. Patients who had any kind of\nlung infection showed higher levels of IL-10 compared to non-infected patients\n(P=0.039). Our results suggest that patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma,\ntreated with MPA, celecoxib and dietary intervention, might have considerable\nimprovement in certain SIMS outcomes. This multitargeted symptomatic approach\ndeserves further study.\n\nPMID: 14711473  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thirty-three chemotherapy-naive\npatients with NSCLC were enrolled in the study and 30 of them were evaluable. The\nmean age of the patients was 61 years. Twenty (66.7%) out of 30 patients were\n>or=60 years, and 5 (16.7%) patients were >or=70 years. The ECOG performance\nstatus was 0 to 1 in 30 patients and 2 in 3 patients. Twenty-six patients (78.8%)\nhad stage IIIB disease and 7 (21.2%) had stage IV; histology was mainly squamous \ncell carcinoma (72.7%). The treatment consisted of cisplatin 40 mg/m2/week and\nepirubicin 40 mg/m2/week both intravenously on day 1, rIL-2 1.8 MIU/day\nsubcutaneously, MPA 1 g/day orally, alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg/day orally and\nN-acetyl cysteine 1.8 g/day orally. The treatment was administered for 6 weeks.\nPatients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease\n(SD) continued the treatment, according to response re-evaluation, until 15\nweeks. The present study reports the results of 6, 9, 12 and 15-week treatment.\nAfter 6 weeks, 30 patients were assessable for response: no CR was observed, a PR\nwas achieved in 15 patients (50%; ORR 50%). After 15 weeks, 1 CR and 8 PR were\nobserved (ORR 30.0%). The median follow-up period was 13 months. The median\nduration of response was 9 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 15\nmonths. The one-year survival rate was 55.8%. The median progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) was 10 months. The toxicity was, as expected, mainly hematologic: \nneutropenia was the most significant symptom. The non-hematologic toxicity was\nquite low. Therefore, the treatment's toxicity was quite acceptable. There was no\ntoxic death. The 30.0% ORR, the 15 month OS and the 10 month PFS obtained in this\nstudy are comparable with those observed with cisplatin plus epirubicin (ORR\n39-54%) in phase II studies and in a previous phase III study (ORR 33%, OS 10.5\nmonths). Moreover, the toxicity was acceptable and it was mainly hematologic.\nSerum levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly decreased after\ntreatment.\n\nPMID: 11956647  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Giorgio 12, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy. mantovan@pacs.unica.it\n\nAn open, non-randomized phase II study was carried out including all patients\ntreated with whatever chemotherapy or combined modality regimen for whatever\ncancer who were in clinical objective response or stable disease (SD) for more\nthan three months, to receive maintenance treatment with recombinant\ninterleukin-2 (rIL-2) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) plus antioxidant\nagents alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). The main study\nendpoints were clinical outcome and toxicity. The secondary endpoints were\neffects of treatment on cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome (CACS)\nsymptoms, on serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-2, C-reactive protein \n(CRP) and leptin as well as the evaluation of quality of life (QL). rIL-2 was\nadministered at a dose of 1.8 MIU subcutaneously three times/week on alternate\ndays for the first two weeks of every month and MPA was given orally at a dose of\n500 mg once a day at alternate days without interruption. ALA 300 mg/day orally\nand NAC 1800 mg/day orally were also administered. The treatment was administered\nuntil progression of disease or appearance of toxicity. From July 1998 to May\n2000, 16 patients were enrolled in the study (M/F ratio: 15/1; mean age: 62\nyears, range 45-71). The median duration of maintenance treatment was 10 months\n(range 5-22). The response to maintenance treatment at September 2000 was: CR\n(persistent throughout the treatment) 4 patients (25%); SD 1 patient (6.2%); PD\n11 patients (68.8%). The median duration of response was 9.8 months (range:\n5-22+). The median follow-up duration was 19 months (range: 8-102). The median OS\nwas not reached. The median PFS was 14 months (range 1-29). The 1-year survival\nrate was 25%. At September 2000, 9 patients are still surviving. No grade 3/4\ntoxicity was observed. One Grade 2 skin toxicity was observed and Grade 1: 2\nfever, 2 thrombocytopenia, 1 neutropenia and 1 skin were observed. The ECOG PS\ndid worsen significantly, the body weight and BMI increased significantly after\ntreatment, whereas the appetite did not change significantly. The QL evaluation\nshowed a significant amelioration of cognitive functions and a borderline\nsignificant amelioration of emotional functions after treatment, whereas a\nborderline worsening of dyspnea was observed. The absolute lymphocyte count\nincreased significantly after the maintenance treatment, as well as the serum\nIL-2, TNFalpha decreased at borderline statistical significance; the serum levels\nof leptin did not change significantly. The evaluation of patient subgroups\nshowed that responders/survivors had a pattern superimposable to that of whole\npatient population, the patients who rapidly progressed and died exhibited no\nsignificant changes of these parameters during treatment. The results of the\npresent study suggest that the host immune response, evaluated by several\nparameters, after IL-2 administration, (e.g. lymphocytosis), are worth further\nstudy as potential markers for the major end points of cancer treatment, i.e. OS \nand QL, in an adequate number of patients.\n\nPMID: 11172608  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nend points were clinical response and toxicity with definition of dose-limiting\ntoxicity and maximal tolerable dose; relief of cancer-related anorexia-cachexia\nsymptoms; the assessment of patient serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6,\ntumor-necrosing factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R).\nFrom March to October 1997, 16 patients (M:F ratio, 14:2; mean age, 60.5 years;\nage range, 41 to 74 years) were enrolled. All patients were evaluable for\ntoxicity and 14 of them for response. The patients were assigned to increasing\ndose levels of drugs according to a dose-escalation schedule. The weekly schedule\nconsisted of a combination of CDDP given intravenously on day 1, EPI given\nintravenously on day 1, 1 g/day medroxyprogesterone acetate given orally on days \n1 to 7, and recombinant IL-2 1.8 MIU administered subcutaneously on days 2 to 7\nplus 300 microg granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support given\nsubcutaneously on days 2 to 5. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate\nbegan 1 week before the first cycle. Dose escalation of the drugs was as follows:\n30 mg x m2 x week(-1) CDDP and 25 mg x m2 x week(-1) EPI (first level, two\npatients); 30 mg x m2 x week(-1) CDDP and 33 mg x m2 x week(-1) EPI (second\nlevel, 2 patients); 40 mg x m2 x week(-1) CDDP and 33 mg x m2 x week(-1) EPI\n(third level, 6 patients); and 40 mg x m2 x week(-1) CDDP and 40 mg x m2 x\nweek(-1) EPI (fourth level, 6 patients). Six cycles were planned for each\npatient. The actual dose intensity delivered was more than 80% of the projected\ndose intensity of all drugs. After six cycles, clinical response (according to\nWorld Health Organization criteria), toxicity (according to World Health\nOrganization criteria), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\nstatus, body weight, appetite, and serum levels of cytokines were evaluated.\nAfter six cycles, 9 of 14 patients (64.3%) had partial response, 3 of 14 (21.4%) \nhad stable disease, and 2 of 14 (14.3%) had progressive disease, and the\nobjective response rate was 64.3%. ECOG performance status and body weight did\nnot change significantly after treatment, whereas appetite showed an increase\nthat was of borderline statistical significance. Toxicity was acceptable and only\nhematologic. Dose-limiting toxicity was established at the fourth dose level;\nconsequently, maximal tolerable dose was assessed at the third dose level. Before\ntreatment, the serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were significantly\ngreater in the patients than in healthy persons. The comparison between\npretreatment and posttreatment serum values of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and\nsIL-2R did not reveal significant differences in the patients. Similar results\nwere obtained when the patients were considered as responders (partial response) \nor non-responders (stable or progressive disease) to therapy. Only IL-6 serum\nlevels were increased (p = 0.014) after treatment.\n\nPMID: 10746553  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Appetite (0 to 10 numerical\nrating scale), weight, and QL (European Organization for Research and Treatment\nof Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC-QLQ-C30]) were assessed before the\nstart of treatment (t = 0), and 6 weeks (t = 6) and 12 weeks (t = 12) thereafter.\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients (68 MPA and 66 placebo) were assessable\nat t = 6 and 99 patients (53 MPA and 46 placebo) at t = 12. A beneficial effect\nof MPA on appetite was observed after both 6 weeks (P = .008) and 12 weeks (P =\n.01) of treatment. After 12 weeks, a mean weight gain of 0.6 +/- 4.4 kg was seen \nin the MPA, versus an ongoing mean weight loss of 1.4 +/- 4.6 kg in the placebo\ngroup. This difference of 2.0 kg was statistically significant (P = .04). During \nthe study, several areas of QL deteriorated in the total group of patients. With \nthe exception of an improvement in appetite and possible also a reduction in\nnausea and vomiting, no measurable beneficial effects of MPA on QL could be\ndemonstrated. The side effects profile of MPA was favorable: only a trend toward \nan increase in (usually mild) peripheral edema was observed.\nCONCLUSION: In weight-losing, advanced-stage non-hormone-sensitive cancer\npatients, MPA exhibits a mild side effects profile, has a beneficial effect on\nappetite, and may prevent further weight loss. However, general QL in the present\nstudy was not measurably influenced by MPA treatment.\n\nPMID: 8648360  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The entire regimen was\ngiven every 4 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. MPA was administered in daily\n500-mg doses, i.m., 5 days a week for 1 month, followed by 1000 mg i.m., once a\nweek, for 5 months. Changes in body weight and appetite were documented. After\ntwo cycles of CT, 64 patients were found to be evaluable for response. Forty-five\nhad non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 19 had small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). \nThirty-seven patients had received CT alone and 27 CT plus MPA. In NSCLC, the\nobjective response to CT alone was 36% versus 37% with CT plus MPA. In SCLC, the \ncorresponding figures were 63% and 22%. The overall objective response rate was\n60% in NSCLC and 48% in SCLC. Median survival using CT alone was 10 months for\nNSCLC patients and 11 months for SCLC patients. Using CT plus MPA, it was 10\nmonths for NSCLC patients and 7 months for SCLC patients. In the control arm,\n1-year survival was 42% for NSCLC patients and 48% for SCLC patients; in those\nwho were given MPA, it was 48% for NSCLC patients and 9% for SCLC patients.\nImproved appetite and weight gain were reported more frequently by MPA patients, \nand they did not complain of CT's usual side effects. The fact that MPA had no\nsignificant effect on CT response or survival in patients also treated with a\ncombination of cisplatin and VP-16, along with the small survival advantage for\nthe control group in SCLC patients, suggests that combining MPA and CT may result\nin improved quality of life.\n\nPMID: 2156416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

MPA-Hematology Italian Cooperative Group.\n\n[No authors listed]\n\nA multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was conducted comparing active\ntreatment with placebo in 227 patients with breast, colorectal, lung and other\nsolid forms of cancer. Combination therapy, (CT) conventionally employed for the \nvarious types of tumor involved, was associated with MPA (117 patients) or\nplacebo (110 patients). MPA was given orally as tablets, as a dose of 500 mg\nb.i.d. for 6 months. The results were, briefly, as follows: The incidence of\nleukopenia was significantly lower in the groups receiving MPA in patients with\nbreast and colorectal cancer (P less than 0.02). Tumors of the lung and other\nsolid forms showed no such difference. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was the \nsame in all disease groups. Objective responses (CR + PR) were observed in 23/46 \n(50%) of breast cancer patients treated with CT + MPA, and in 13/47 (28%) of\nthose given CT + placebo. The difference was significant (P less than 0.02).\nSubjective parameters also showed more improvement in the MPA group than in the\npatients given CT alone. No significant differences were found for the other\ntypes of tumor, but the numbers in this population were very limited. In a group \nof 45 patients, antithrombin III a (%), antithrombin III R: Ag (%), plasminogen\n(mg/dl), alpha-2 macroglobulin (%), factor VIII C (%), factor VIII R: Ag (%) and \nfactor IX C (%) were determined. The most interesting post-treatment findings\nwere an increase in anti-thrombin III (activity and antigen level) and in\nplasminogen. This suggests that MPA does not increase the risk of thrombosis, and\nmight even, to some extent, impede tumor-induced thrombophilia.(ABSTRACT\nTRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 2871945  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Clinical experience with 44 cases].\n\n[Article in Italian]\n\nAmadori D, Ravaioli A, Barbanti F.\n\nMAP was used in high doses (1 g/die up to a total dose of 45-50 g) in 44 cases of\nadvanced mammary carcinoma (IIIrd and IVth stage of the T.N.M. classification),\nevaluated according to the criteria proposed by CBCG. The excellent tolerance to \nthe drug, even at such high doses, is stressed. Therapeutic responses were best\nin cases of metastasis in the soft and bony tissues and in cases of pulmonary\nmetastasis. It is pointed out that the effectiveness of the treatment is\nparticularly evident in patients in whom the free interval has exceeded two years\nand in patients in the menopause for more than five years. In the light of\nresults obtained, the possibility of introducing the drug into the therapeutic\nstrategy of this condition is discussed.\n\nPMID: 74811  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The average age was 63 years and the patients\nwere, on the average, 14 years' postmenopausal. Only two patients had received no\nprior additive hormone therapy. The remainder had previously received estrogen,\nandrogens, or both. Only two patients had objective evidence of tumor regression.\nIn one patient a metastatic node disappeared for 7+ months, and the other patient\nhad well-documented clinical improvement and control of brain mestastases for 22 \nmonths. Two other patients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases\n(regression of some but not all lesions), lasting 3 and 4 months respectively.\nFive other patients had obvious subjective benefit. There were four objective\nresponses (10%) and five subjective responses (12%). There was no correlation\nbetween route of administration and response. All patients receiving benefit had \npreviously responded to other hormones. Side effects were usually absent or\nconsisted of mild fluid retention; however, four patients had disease stimulation\nfrom therapy.\n\nPIP: Progesterone, like estrogens, is used in the treatment of metastatic breast \ncancer. The 3 most active derivatives are megestrol, norethisterone acetate, and \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). This study evaluates the use of MPA in\ntreating metastatic breast cancer in 40 postmenopausal women (average age, 63\nyears; average duration of postmenopause, 14 years) who have either not responded\nto or have relapsed after therapy with estrogens and androgens. 18 patients\nreceived a depot preparation of MPA intramuscularly in a loading dose of 3.2 g\nover a 2-week period and then 400 mg at 2-4 week intervals. 22 patients received \nthe drug orally in a dose of 200 to 300 mg daily. Patients were evaluated after 6\nweeks of therapy. Criteria for evaluating response were those used by the Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group. Only 2 of 40 patients exhibited an objective response\n(disappearance of metastatic lymph node for 9 months in 1 and well-documented\nclinical improvement and control of brain metastases for 22 months in another). 2\npatients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases (regression of some but not\nall lesions) lasting 3 and 4 months respectively. 5 patients had obvious\nsubjective response (pain relief) but no objective response. Overall response\nrate was 22%: 4 objective responses (10%) and 5 subjectives responses (12%).\nRoute of administration did not correlate with response. Tumor stimulation and\nclinical deterioration occurred in 4 patients. It appears that MPA therapy is\ncostly and of minimal usefulness as secondary therapy in metastatic breast\ncancer. Further studies should focus on megestrol and norethisterone acetate\nwhich have been documented to have better response rates.\nPMID: 1260780  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Breast\ncancer mortality among participants in the trial has not been previously\nreported.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of therapy with estrogen plus progestin on\ncumulative breast cancer incidence and mortality after a total mean follow-up of \n11.0 (SD, 2.7) years, through August 14, 2009.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50\nto 79 years with no prior hysterectomy from 40 US clinical centers were randomly \nassigned to receive combined conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, or placebo pill. After the original trial \ncompletion date (March 31, 2005), reconsent was required for continued follow-up \nfor breast cancer incidence and was obtained from 12,788 (83%) of the surviving\nparticipants.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Invasive breast cancer incidence and breast cancer\nmortality.\nRESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses including all randomized participants and\ncensoring those not consenting to additional follow-up on March 31, 2005,\nestrogen plus progestin was associated with more invasive breast cancers compared\nwith placebo (385 cases [0.42% per year] vs 293 cases [0.34% per year]; hazard\nratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.46; P = .004). Breast\ncancers in the estrogen-plus-progestin group were similar in histology and grade \nto breast cancers in the placebo group but were more likely to be node-positive\n(81 [23.7%] vs 43 [16.2%], respectively; HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.23-2.58; P = .03).\nThere were more deaths directly attributed to breast cancer (25 deaths [0.03% per\nyear] vs 12 deaths [0.01% per year]; HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.00-4.04; P = .049) as\nwell as more deaths from all causes occurring after a breast cancer diagnosis (51\ndeaths [0.05% per year] vs 31 deaths [0.03% per year]; HR, 1.57; 95% CI,\n1.01-2.48; P = .045) among women who received estrogen plus progestin compared\nwith women in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin was associated with greater breast cancer\nincidence, and the cancers are more commonly node-positive. Breast cancer\nmortality also appears to be increased with combined use of estrogen plus\nprogestin.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMID: 20959578  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The Programme Etude Rein Cytokines (PERCY)\nQuattro trial was designed to evaluate both cytokines for their survival benefit \nto intermediate prognosis patients, who represent the majority of candidates for \nthese treatments.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized in a 2-by-2 factorial design to\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate 200 mg daily, interferon-alfa 9 million IU 3 times a \nweek, subcutaneous interleukin-2 9 million IU daily, or a combination of both\ncytokines. Tumor response was evaluated at Week 12 and Month 6; progression-free \npatients received further identical treatment for a maximum of 3 additional\nmonths. Primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints were\ndisease-free survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life. Survival was\nanalyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nRESULTS: From January 2000 to July 2004, 492 patients were enrolled. Analysis was\nperformed after a 29.2-month median follow-up (range, 0 months to 54.6 months).\nThere were no significant survival differences between the 244\ninterferon-alfa-treated patients and 248 noninterferon-alfa patients (hazard\nratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81-1.24) or between the 247 interleukin-2 and 245\nnoninterleukin-2-treated patients (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87-1.33; log\nrank, 0.99 and 0.52, respectively). Grade 3-4 toxicities were significantly more \nfrequent in cytokine-treated patients than in medroxyprogesterone-treated\npatients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous interleukin-2 and/or interferon-alfa provide no\nsurvival benefit in metastatic renal cancers of intermediate prognosis, and they \ninduce a significant risk of toxicity. Newly available angiogenesis inhibitors\nshould be preferred for these patients.\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 American Cancer Society.\n\nPMID: 17932908  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Unfortunately the promising results obtained in biological studies have\nnot yet been confirmed in clinical studies. One reason is linked to the\nimmunosuppression of metastatic patients which is caused by macrophage products. \nIL-6 in particular is considered a growth factor for RCC. Medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) may interfere with IL-6 macrophage production, possibly causing a\nsynergistic effect in association with IL-2 and IFN-alpha. Therefore the purpose \nof our study was to evaluate the toxicity and the efficacy of the association\nbetween IL-2, IFN-alpha and MPA.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with metastatic RCC were\nenrolled. IL-2 was administered subcutaneously at doses of 4.5 million UI on days\n1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26; IFN-alpha was administered s.c. at a dose of 3\nmillion t.t.w; MPA was administered orally at a dose of 1000 mg daily. This\nschedule was repeated after a rest of 2 weeks.\nRESULTS: Toxicity was mild: the main symptoms observed were fatigue and fever.\nSix CR (14%), five PR (12%), thirteen SD (31%) and seventeen PD (41%) were\nobserved for an overall response rate of 26%. Patients with good PS and low\nlevels of CRP had a better prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: Considering both the good activity and the low toxicity of this\nscheme, we think that it could be carried out in normal clinical practice.\n\nPMID: 12530040  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

They were classified into two groups on the basis of whether they\nunderstood or not. We estimated their survival after the time of registration and\nderived relative hazard ratios from Cox's proportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: There were 190 patients in the 'better understanding' group and 24 in\nthe 'poor understanding' group. Median survival times after registration were\n28.3 and 16.1 months, respectively. The 'better understanding' group showed a\nsignificant difference from the 'poor understanding' group (p = 0.016). In\nmultivariate regression analysis, patients who did not understand still showed\npoorer survival than those who understood (hazard ratio = 2.09; 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) 1.16-3.78; p = 0.014).\nCONCLUSION: These results support the supposition that patients' understanding of\ninformation about their disease may influence their survival. Thus, it is\nimportant to evaluate patients' recognition about information even after\nobtaining their consent. However, further investigation is needed to clarify the \nexact nature of this relationship.\n\nPMID: 10942100  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Recommendations regarding local\ntreatment as well as adjuvant systemic therapy did not change during this period.\nPatients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to receive additional\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment. Only 59 (10%) patients received\npostoperative irradiation (XRT) to the chest wall and/or axillary lymph nodes;\nanother 121 (20%) patients received XRT to the internal mammary nodes because of \ncentromedially located tumours.\nRESULTS: Patients were followed for a median period of 7.5 years. The event-free \nsurvival at 10 years was 50%. The cumulative incidence rate of LRR at 10 years\nwas 18% (n = 93), either with (n = 30) or without (n = 63) concurrent distant\nmetastases. The chest wall, regional lymph nodes or both were involved in 41\n(44%), 38 (41%) and 12 (13%) patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis\naccording to the Cox model revealed two factors associated with LRR, i.e. pT (P <\n0.05) and nodal status (P < 0.05). In node-positive patients extracapsular tumour\nextension (ECE) and pT were independent risk factors. DNA ploidy and S-phase\nfraction did not yield additional information. Based on pT, nodal status and\nextracapsular extension of tumour growth a high risk (> 10%) and low risk (< 10%)\ngroup for LRR could be identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that T-stage and nodal status, combined with ECE,\nmay help to identify patients at risk for loco-regional recurrence, whereas DNA\nflow cytometry does not.\n\nPMID: 10392812  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Medical Research Council Renal Cancer Collaborators.\n\n[No authors listed]\n\nComment in\n    Lancet. 1999 Jan 2;353(9146):6-7.\n\nBACKGROUND: Metastatic renal carcinoma has a 2-year survival of around 20% and is\nlargely resistant to chemotherapy. The use of interferons in the treatment of\nmetastatic renal carcinoma remains controversial. Although non-randomised studies\nsuggest that biological therapy with interferons produces a small number of\ntumour responses, most clinicians judge such treatment to be ineffective. We have\ninvestigated the effect of treatment with interferon-alpha on survival in\npatients with metastatic renal carcinoma.\nMETHODS: In a multicentre, randomised trial, patients with metastatic renal\ncarcinoma were randomly assigned subcutaneous interferon-alpha (three doses--5\nMU, 5 MU, 10 MU--for the first week, then 10 MU three times per week for a\nfurther 11 weeks; n=174) or oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 300 mg once\ndaily for 12 weeks; n=176). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis\nwas by intention to treat. The trial used a triangular sequential design for\nearly termination as soon as results were conclusive. The trial was stopped in\nNovember, 1997, when data were available for 335 patients (167 interferon-alpha, \n168 MPA).\nFINDINGS: A total of 111 patients have died in the interferon-alpha group, and\n125 patients have died in the MPA group. There was a 28% reduction in the risk of\ndeath in the interferon-alpha group (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.55-0.94],\np=0.017). Interferon-alpha gave an improvement in 1-year survival of 12% (MPA 31%\nsurvival, interferon-alpha 43%), and an improvement in median survival of 2.5\nmonths (MPA 6 months, interferon-alpha 8.5 months).\nINTERPRETATION: The benefit of treatment with interferon-alpha should be weighed \nagainst the drug's toxic effects. Combination regimens of biological therapy and \nchemotherapy should now be compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in\nrandomised controlled trials.\n\nPMID: 10023944  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In this study, the serum MPA\nconcentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and\nevaluated for its usefulness in predicting the response in 79 cases of advanced\nor recurrent breast cancers. Overall, 29 patients (37%) achieved an objective\nresponse. The response rate correlated significantly with the oestrogen receptor \n(ER) status (P = 0.03), proliferative activity determined by DNA polymerase alpha\n(P = 0.04), the disease-free interval (DFI) (P = 0.05) and the serum MPA\nconcentration (P < 0.001). Patients with ER-positive tumours, lower proliferative\nactivity, a longer (DFI) or a higher serum MPA concentration responded more\nfrequently. The mean serum MPA concentration in the responders with ER-positive\ntumours (P = 0.01) or tumours with a lower proliferative activity (P = 0.008)\nwere significantly lower than in cases with ER-negative tumours or tumours with a\nhigher proliferative activity, respectively. Cases with soft tissue metastases\nshowed responses at significantly lower MPA concentrations (P = 0.003) than those\nwith bone or visceral metastases. Furthermore, there was a dramatic decrease in\nthe MPA concentration when a responder with a high concentration became\nunresponsive to the therapy. Thus, the serum MPA concentration is a determining\nfactor for the response to treatment.\n\nPMID: 9337682  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

First, 1 course of CAF therapy was\nadministered; then, in combination with the basic therapy of 5-FU 200 mg/day p.\no. for 3 years, ER (+) patients were treated with either 2-week sequential\ntherapy of TAM (30 mg/day) and MPA (800 mg/day) or TAM (30 mg/day), and ER (-)\npatients received either MPA (800 mg/day) or 5-FU alone. Neither survival nor\ndisease-free rates of the 92 analyzable patients were different between these\ntreatment groups. Furthermore, the blood levels of MPA and cortisol had no\ncorrelation with survival and disease-free periods. We studied the effect of MPA \non the natural inhibitors of blood coagulation, but found no difference from the \nresult in healthy adults. It was, however, shown that MPA had a bone\nmarrow-protecting effect.\n\nPMID: 8751803  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy using epirubicin (EPI), used in\nconjunction with daily doses of 1,200 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), have \nrecently been performed. This procedure has shown remarkable histological effects\nin the metastatic lymph nodes as well as in the primary lesions. These results\nwere especially remarkable in the patients who were administered MPA (daily) two \nweeks prior to EPI infusion. These patients showed a complete disappearance of\ntumor cells. The results were interesting in view of the mechanism of action.\nIntra-arterial infusion chemotherapy combined with MPA may also be valuable in\ntreating metastatic liver tumors and recurrent lesions in the regional lymph\nnodes such as supraclavicular tumors. A high response rate was obtained in the\nchemo-endocrine therapy when combined with MPA as a pretreatment. Thus, MPA may\nbe expected to be available as a systemic therapy, too. In the future, a new\ndevelopment in the field of intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy may be achieved \nby utilizing a combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and peripheral blood stem\ncell transplantation.\n\nPMID: 7747999  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Urological Working Party Renal Carcinoma Subgroup.\n\nFayers PM(1), Cook PA, Machin D, Donaldson N, Whitehead J, Ritchie A, Oliver RT, \nYuen P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)MRC Cancer Trials Office, Cambridge, U.K.\n\nThis paper describes the steps taken by the British Medical Research Council\n(MRC) in developing the MRC RE01 trial, a randomized clinical trial for patients \nwith metastatic renal cancer; we discuss the reasons for adopting a triangular\nsequential design and the impact that this has upon the monitoring of the trial. \nIt had been suggested to the MRC that a trial of biological agents for metastatic\nrenal carcinoma should be initiated. The Cancer Therapy Committee (CTC) of the\nMRC, through its associated site specific working parties, is responsible for\ndesigning and co-ordinating randomized trials of alternative treatments in cancer\nin solid tumours. Since no MRC working party for renal carcinoma existed at that \ntime, development began by the formation of an ad hoc group set up under the\nauspices of the CTC. They assessed, by means of a postal questionnaire, U.K.\ninterest in the trials of, and modalities utilized for, treatment of renal\ncancer. The responses focused attention on the important questions to ask and\nindicated the level of potential collaboration. These responses and related\nclinical and statistical issues suggested a protocol to compare\nmedroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) against alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In view \nof the special problems of comparing an expensive and potentially toxic therapy\nwith an inexpensive and non-toxic standard, a sequential design was used rather\nthan a fixed sample size design. Statistical issues raised and solutions provided\nare described. The method of establishing the trial data monitoring committee and\na brief review of mortality from renal carcinoma in England and Wales are also\nincluded. The trial opened to patient recruitment on 1 January 1992. The formal\nstatements regarding statistical issues that appear in the formal trial protocol \n(RE01) are set out in the Appendix.\n\nPMID: 7846423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of the 293 patients \nreceiving second line hormone therapy, only 161 were available for third line\ntreatment. In phase 1, 153 patients were treated with AG: 36% had objective\nresponses (complete or partial); of 140 patient receiving MPA, 33% had objective \nresponses (p = 0.045, significant). In the AG-treated group, duration of response\nwas 11.3 +/- 8.4 months as against 8.3 +/- 5.6 months in the MPA group (p = 0.07,\nsignificant). In phase 2, 87 women previously treated with MPA received AG, and\n74 previously AG-treated patients were given MPA. There were no significant\ndifferences in the results obtained. In conclusion, there were no significant\ndifferences in the results obtained by AG and MPA treatment as far as toxicity\nand survival was concerned but there was a statistically significant advantage\nfor AG as second and third line management both as to objective responses and\nmean time until renewed progression of the disease.\n\nPMID: 7955956  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

MPA may be of advantage in this setting because of its\nactivity in estrogen receptor ER-positive as well as ER-negative tumors and since\nit may protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and thus enable\nmaintenance of the appropriate chemotherapeutic scheduling.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eight evaluable patients with node-positive\n(N+) operable breast cancer (T1-3, N1) were entered in a multicenter randomized\ntrial. Two hundred nine patients were randomized in the MPA- arm and 199 in the\nMPA+ arm. CAF chemotherapy was given as a short i.v. bolus infusion:\ncyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, and\n5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, q 4 wks x 6. MPA was given intramuscularly\n(i.m.) 500 mg q d x 28 days, followed by 500 mg i.m. twice weekly during 5\nmonths.\nRESULTS: The main side effects of MPA were weight gain with a mean of 5.5 kg as\nopposed to 1.8 kg in the control group (p = 0.01) and vaginal bleeding in 30/199 \nin the MPA+ group and 0 in the MPA- group. MPA ameliorated vomiting grade III, IV\n(45% vs. 28%, p < 0.001), nausea grade III, IV (50% vs. 34%, p < 0.001) and\nleucocyte nadir grade III, IV (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.003). Disease-free survival\n(DFS) after 5 years was 59% in the MPA+ and 49% in the MPA- group (p = 0.12).\nPatients > or = 60 years benefitted most from MPA treatment, in particular if\nfreedom from distant metastases was taken as the endpoint (p = 0.02). Overall\nsurvival (OS) was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (p\n= 0.18), but within subgroups analysed there was an advantage for MPA+ in\npatients > or = 55 years (p = 0.002) and in pT1 patients (p = 0.045).\nCONCLUSIONS: High-dose MPA ameliorates CAF side effects and reduces the risk of\nmetastatic disease, especially in elderly breast cancer patients.\n\nPMID: 8518219  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In a\nmulticentric study, we have studied the effectiveness of buserelin in patients\nwith previously untreated histologically confirmed metastatic prostate cancer.\nFifty-eight patients were enrolled in the study and are now followed for at least\n12 months. The treatment consisted of 500 micrograms buserelin administered\nsubcutaneously (s.c.) 3 times daily for the first seven days and thereafter a\nthrice-daily dose of 400 micrograms buserelin administered intranasally (i.n.). A\ncontinuous reduction of testosterone to castrate levels could be obtained in all \npatients. The following objective responses were seen during the 12 months study \nperiod: 5 patients (8.6%) achieved complete regression after 3-10 months (mean\n6.4 m); 24 patients (41.4%) achieved partial regression after 1-12 months (mean\n4.5 m); 7 patients (12%) remained stable throughout the study; 22 patients\n(32.3%) developed progression after 2-12 months (mean 7.2 m). Toxicity was\nminimal. Only one patient dropped out of the study because of side effects. These\nresults are comparable with results of other forms of hormonal treatment of\nprostate cancer. Long-term results of 3 EORTC GU group comparative studies in\nmetastatic prostate cancer are now available. The first study, 30761, compared\ncyproterone acetate, medroxy-progesterone acetate, and DES. No differences\nbetween the 3 treatment arms were observed except for medroxy-progesterone\nacetate, which showed less therapeutic effect in the dosage used. Protocol 30762 \ncompared DES and estramustine phosphate. No significant difference in objective\nresponse and survival was noted. Protocol 30805 studied a comparison between\norchiectomy alone and orchiectomy supplemented by cyproterone acetate and DES.\nAgain no statistically significant difference was found between the three\ntherapeutic arms.\n\nPMID: 2968760  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In randomized clinical trials involving postmenopausal patients,\ntamoxifen has been found to be as effective as high-dose estrogens, androgens,\nprogestins, and the aromatase inhibitor, aminoglutethimide. Because of its\nremarkable lack of significant toxicity, tamoxifen is now considered the first\nendocrine treatment of choice of hormone-responsive postmenopausal breast cancer.\nAlthough effective in a significant fraction of premenopausal patients, tamoxifen\ncannot be considered a substitute for ovariectomy because it usually does not\nsuppress menses and because response to castration may occur after progression\nduring antiestrogen therapy. Current evidence suggests that there is no major\nadvantage in combining tamoxifen with other endocrine therapies or chemotherapy. \nAt present, it appears preferable to use different modalities of endocrine\ntherapy sequentially in those patients with hormone-responsive cancers.\nChemotherapy should be delayed until maximum benefit has been obtained from\nendocrine therapy.\n\nPMID: 2950193  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, multicenter trials require strong efforts for quality\nassurance concerning admission, treatment and follow-up, thus a highly developed \ncoordinating center is needed. Data on recruitment and protocol compliance, i.e. \ndeviations from the study protocol, are presented for the study of the treatment \nof metastatic renal cell carcinoma and discussed with respect to their impact on \nthe results of the study. 102 patients were randomized either for IFN alpha-2C or\nIFN alpha-2C plus medroxyprogesteroneacetate. 16% of the patients violated\ninclusion criteria and essential data were missing in 16% of the patients.\nOverall treatment results (remission rate of 5.6%, median survival time of 7\nmonths) and the data on adverse events have been biased by lack of protocol\ncompliance.

Ninety-two patients entered this\ntrial, of whom 86 were evaluable for final analysis. Hyperprolactinemic patients \n(n = 31) were randomized to receive VAC/FMC chemotherapy with or without\nbromoergocryptine. Normoprolactinemic patients with 'low risk' metastatic disease\n(disease-free interval greater than 30 months, ER/PR positive or unknown) were\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone acetate or VAC/FMC chemotherapy.\nNormoprolactinemic 'high risk' patients (n = 42) (disease-free interval less than\n30 months, EP/PR negative) received VAC/FMC chemotherapy with or without\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP). The results show that bromoergocryptine does\nnot improve response rate, duration of response and survival. Median survival of \npatients with elevated basal plasma prolactin (greater than 15 ng/ml) is reduced \nto 9 months compared to patients with normal basal plasma prolactin (17 months,\nlog-rank p = 0.005). Unexpectedly, TRH stimulation proved inappropriate to\nseparate normo- and hyperprolactinemic patients in terms of survival.\nNormoprolactinemic 'low risks' (tamoxifen failures) were observed to qualify for \nfurther hormone therapy (median survival 21+ months). Normoprolactinemic 'high\nrisks' showed median survival of about 12 months with no apparent benefit for\nthose receiving MAP, additionally. The results suggest that basal\nhyperprolactinemia, disease free interval, ER/PR receptor status, and liver\nmetastasis are important prognostic variables. Endocrine and cytotoxic\nchemotherapy should be selected according to these risk factors.\n\nPMID: 2950359  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The study included 150 patients and\nwas well-balanced with respect to different prognostic parameters. Most patients \n(83%) were postmenopausal, and 95% had previously received chemo- or hormonal\ntherapy. In the MPA treated patients, analysis of serum MPA levels was performed \nonce a month. The response rates were 4.6, 7.9 and 12.5% in treatments A, B and\nC, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (P greater\nthan 0.05). Furthermore, the follow-up of serum MPA levels revealed no\nsignificant difference between responders and non-responders. Analysis of time to\nprogression did not indicate any advantage of MPA over prednisone, irrespective\nof MPA schedule.

All 25 patients were followed until time of death and all were able\nto receive hormonal therapy. We did not find substantially improved response\nrates when combination chemotherapy was applied before endocrine treatment since \nthe 33% objective response rate to chemotherapy was only minimally higher than\nthe response in our patients who had failed hormonal therapy and then received\nidentical or similar chemotherapy. Furthermore, the introduction of intensive\ncombination chemotherapy before hormonal therapy in our study did not result in\nany striking improvement in overall survival compared with patients who received \ninitial hormonal therapy in many other studies. Responses to chemotherapy were\nnot attributable to suppression of serum testosterone since all 12 patients with \npartial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) and four of seven patients with no\nresponse (NR) had normal testosterone levels at the time of response assessment. \nThe initial use of chemotherapy did not adversely affect the expected high\npercentage of objective responses (68%) to subsequent hormonal manipulation. The \nfrequency, duration, and quality of responses to hormonal therapy exceeded the\nresponses to chemotherapy. The disappointing responses to chemotherapy reflect\nthe very modest efficacy of even aggressively delivered cytotoxic agents.\n\nPMID: 2943877  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A randomized\ncrossover trial in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.\n\nvan Veelen H, Willemse PH, Tjabbes T, Schweitzer MJ, Sleijfer DT.\n\nIn a prospective randomized multicenter study in previously untreated\npostmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer, the response to treatment\nwith oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 300 mg three times daily was compared\nwith tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg twice daily. Of 61 patients treated with MPA, 27 (44%)\nhad a partial or complete remission, 6 showed no change, and 28 had progressive\ndisease. Of 68 patients treated with TAM, 24 (35%) showed a remission, 15 no\nchange, and 29 progression. The difference in response rate is not significant.\nHowever, 11 of 25 patients with osseous metastases as predominant site, responded\nto MPA and 7 of 31 to TAM (P = 0.05). Moreover, in patients older than age 70\nyears, 13 of 26 responded to MPA and 6 of 31 to TAM (P less than 0.05). Median\nduration of remission of all patients in the MPA arm was 17 months and in the TAM\narm, 23 months (not significant). Median survival was 20 months for MPA and 26\nmonths for TAM (not significant). After cross-over from TAM to MPA 8 of 31\npatients responded and after cross-over from MPA to TAM, no response was seen in \n27 patients. These data indicate that the response rate and duration to MPA and\nTAM are comparable, except in patients with osseous metastases and in patients\nolder than age 70 years. MPA has more side effects, but seems to be more\neffective after cross-over, and may thus be reserved for second-line treatment.\n\nPMID: 2939943  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients received either tamoxifen (T) alone or T in \ncombination with medroxyprogesterone acetate, diethylstilbestrol, halotestin, or \naminoglutethimide. The overall response rate was 40%. Responses were most\nfrequently seen in patients with metastases in soft tissue, and the duration of\nresponse to endocrine therapy in these patients was longer than for those with\nmetastases in bone or viscera (p less than 0.00001). In addition, the response\nrate was inversely correlated with the number of main metastatic sites in\npatients with soft tissue metastases, whereas the response rate was not\nassociated with the number of metastatic sites in patients with metastases in\nbone and viscera. Survival after first recurrence was significantly longer in\nresponding patients with soft tissue lesions compared to those with recurrence in\nbone or viscera. In contrast, survival after first recurrence was identical in\npatients with nonresponding disease, irrespective of dominant site of metastases.\nThe outcome of endocrine therapy depends partially upon the dominant site of\nmetastases. This may reflect a difference in biological characteristics of human \nbreast cancer tumor cells that metastasize to different sites.\n\nPMID: 3593985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sixty-four patients were available\nfor evaluation of efficacy and toxicity. Thirty patients received treatment A:\ntamoxifen 30 mg per day alternating every two weeks with medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) 1 000 mg per day orally. Thirty-four received treatment B:\ntamoxifen 30 mg per day and after relapse, high dosage of MPA alone. The\ndistribution of the evaluable metastasis and the value of the ER are the same in \nthe two groups. The total responses or the responses by metastatic site were as\nfollows: complete response, one case in each treatment group, partial response, 6\nand 10 cases, no change, 14 and 17 cases and progressive disease, 9 and 6 cases\nrespectively. The duration of the response was the same in the two groups with a \nmedian of 6 months (extremes of 30 and 19 months). Among the patients under\nprotocol B, 19 received MPA after failure of tamoxifen: eight responded (3\npartial responses and 5 no change).

Recently, the effects of progestins on adrenal\nfunction has become the subject of renewed interest. To find a relation between\nplasma levels of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and adrenal suppression in\nbreast cancer patients, we compared a group of 41 postmenopausal patients with\ndisseminated or inoperable breast cancer, treated with oral MPA, with a control\ngroup of 28 postmenopausal breast cancer patients without treatment. To obtain\nMPA plasma levels in the lower range, 13 patients initially received 300 mg of\nMPA daily (Group 1), six of whom were subsequently treated with 600 mg (Group 2).\nGroup 3 comprised 37 patients treated with 900 mg of MPA. All of the parameters\nstudied varied widely. Only in Group 3 patients were the MPA levels higher and\nthe levels of cortisol, androstenedione, DHAS, and estrone lower than those in\nGroup 1 patients. All steroid levels in Group 3 were significantly below control \nvalues. Considering all data, a negative but weak correlation was found between\nMPA levels and cortisol (R = -0.55), androstenedione (R = -0.58), and\ndehydro-epi-androsterone sulfate (R = -0.40), but not for MPA and estrone,\nindicating better adrenal suppression by higher MPA dosage and plasma levels.\nHowever, suppressed cortisol concentrations did not predict sufficient MPA dosage\nin all patients because low cortisol was not always associated with high MPA\nlevels. A positive relation existed between the levels of androstenedione and\nestrone, which shows that suppression of these adrenal androgens may result in\nsuppression of plasma estrone. This may be of additional therapeutic benefit in\nbreast cancer patients.\n\nPMID: 3161613  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

No measurable remission was observed, but 8 of 24\nevaluable patients (33%) had disease stabilization for a median duration of 6\nmonths. One hundred thirty-six cases with category M0 cancer were randomly\nallocated to a control group or to a treatment group with MPA 500 mg/3 times a\nweek for one year. After a median follow-up period of over 3 years, 30 of 121\nevaluable patients (24.8%) had a relapse, usually in distant sites. Relapses and \nsurvival were independent from postoperative treatment and sex. Only the extent\nof the disease and the presence of steroid receptors in the tumor were related\nwith prognosis, but no relation could be found between receptors and response to \nhormone treatment. The presence of low concentrations of hormone receptors in a\nproportion of renal cancers remains unclear.

In the induction phase they received either 1,000 mg intramuscular (IM)\nMPA (high dose) daily or 500 mg IM MPA (low dose) twice weekly for four weeks.\nThe maintenance treatment consisted of 500 mg MPA IM once weekly for all\npatients. In total, 184 patients were considered evaluable. The response rate was\nsignificantly higher (p = 0.004) for patients receiving high-dose MPA (30 [33%]\nof 91) as compared to the women receiving the low-dose regimen (14 [15%] of 93)\nand was consistent across all prognostic subgroups. These prognostic subgroups\nincluded soft-tissue and osseous metastases, two metastatic sites, patients\ngreater than 60 years, disease-free interval greater than 60 months, no prior\nchemotherapy, patients with a response to the last hormonal treatment before MPA,\nunknown estrogen receptors, and positive progestin receptors. The two different\nschedules of MPA did not influence the time to progression and the survival.\nToxicity was similar in both regimens. These results confirm that a higher\nresponse rate can be achieved with a more intensive MPA schedule. This treatment \nmay represent an ideal second-line choice in the endocrine therapy of advanced\nbreast cancer; however, its role as a first-line treatment remains to be defined.\n\nPMID: 6233398  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Recent Results Cancer Res. 1980;71:134-41.\n\nTherapeutic effect of tamoxifen related to estrogen receptor level.\n\nRose C, Thorpe SM, L\xc3\xb8ber J, Daenfeldt JL, Palshof T, Mouridsen HT.\n\nCytoplasmic oestrogen receptor (ER) determinations were performed in 59\npostmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer. Fifty percent of the\npatients were found to be ER+. Forty patients were treated with tamoxifen (TAM)\nand 19 patients were treated with tamoxifen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MPA). The response rate of TAM-treated patients was 30% (12/40). Of the 21 ER+\npatients, ten (48%) responded to therapy. The ER values of these patients were\nsignificantly higher than the ER values of nonresponders (P less than 0.01). No\ncorrelation could be found between the ER value and the duration of remission in \nTAM-treated patients.\n\nPIP: In this study of 59 postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer,\nthe therapeutic effect of tamoxifen (TAM) and/or TAM plus medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) was investigated and its effectiveness was related to the patients \nestrogen receptor (ER) levels. 3 studies are discussed: 1) Study 1, in which TAM \nwas used alone; 2) Study 2, in which TAM was tested against TAM+MPA; and 3) Study\n3, in which TAM was tested against TAM+diethylstilbestrol (DES). In this\nunselected population of post menopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, \nthe overall response rate to TAM treatment was 80% (12/40). Of 21 ER positive\npatients, 10 (48%) responded to TAM therapy. The ER values of these patients were\nsignificantly higher than the ER values of nonresponders (P .001), but no\ncorrelation was found between the ER value and the duration of remission in\nTAM-treated patients. These results are from the population of Studies 1 and 2;\nStudy 3's population was too small for significant findings to be reported.\nPMID: 6988911  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A low order or response was observed, and these agents\nwere not proven effective as treatment for metastatic renal cell cancer.\nPerformance status and a relatively long symptom-free interval from primary tumor\nto metastatic disease were found to be the most prognostically significant\nfactors for survival.\n\nPIP: Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer have an overall 5-year survival\nrate of only 28% to 40% in spite of aggressive surgical treatment. A prospective \nrandomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group used\nmethyl--CCNU (meCCNU), vinblastine, and meCCNU-medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) \nto treat 165 patients with advanced renal cancer. The antitumor activity of the\nsingle-agent and/or combination therapy is analyzed. Patients were classified (as\nto grade of anaplasia of tumor; age; performance status; primary site of\nmetastatic disease; and previous treatment with a progestational agent) and\nrandomly assigned to various treatment protocols as described. Crossover\nrandomization to one of alternate single-agent or combination regimens was\ncarried out after failure with initial therapy. 2 meCCNU regimens were associated\nwith severe hematologic toxicity, vinblastine regimens with neurotoxicity. All\nregimens except the vinblastine-MPA resulted in substantial vomiting. Response\nrate is low (11%) with each regimen. There were no statistically significant\ndifferences in treatment variables or factors among the various regimens.\nPatients capable of normal activity had a significantly higher response rate and \nlonger survival period than nonambulatory or poor performance status patients. A \nrelatively long symptom-free interval from primary tumor to metastatic disease\nwas also associated with better survival rate. More than 50% of patients\nexhibited disease progression with 3 months of initiating the regimens.\nPMID: 356971  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Tumori. 1978 Apr 30;64(2):143-9.\n\nHigh dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment in metastatic carcinoma of \nthe breast: a dose-response evaluation.\n\nCuna GR, Calciati A, Strada MR, Bumma C, Campio L.\n\nThe results of controlled clinical trial that used high doses of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer\nare reported. Two treatment reigmens were used: regimen A, 500 mg daily with a\ntotal dose of 30 g; regimen B, 1,000 mg daily with a total dose of 60 g. The\noverall response rates were similar, with no statistically significant difference\nbetween the two treated groups. Regimen A (lower dosage group) reached a\nremission rate of 44%, whereas regimen B (higher dosage group) had a remission\nrate of 41%. The mean duration of response was 8 months with regimen A and 9\nmonths with regimen B. The advantages of the lower dosage regimen as opposed to\nthe higher dosage regimen of MPA in the treatment of advanced breast cancer are\ndiscussed.\n\nPIP: A controlled clinical trial that used high doses of medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer was conducted. Therapy\nconsisted of 2 treatments: regimen A, 500 mg daily with a total dose of 30 g;\nregimen B, 1000 mg daily with a total dose of 60 g. From June 1975 to September\n1976, 101 patients entered into the study and were randomly allocated into the 2 \ntreatment groups. Both treatment groups were comparable in terms of age,\nmenopausal status, free interval, and dominant site of lesions. Selection of\npatients was done according to the following criteria: histologically proved\nprogressive metastatic carcinoma of the breast, without any treatment for at\nleast 2 months; no prior hormonal manipulation; performance status 50 or more,\nand life expectancy longer than 3 months; measurable disease. Overall response\nrates were similar, with no statistically significant difference between the 2\ntreated groups. Regimen A reached a remission rate of 44%; regimen B had a\nremission rate of 41%. The mean duration of response was 8 months with regimen A \nand 9 months with regimen B. Both regimens were well tolerated. Clinical toxicity\nwas mild with both dosages of MPA. The main side effect was gluteus abscess, with\na higher incidence in group B. This was probably due to the greater amount of\ninjected drug suspension in the 1000 mg/day regimen. The incidence of\nthrombophlebitis and vaginal bleeding was negligible.\nPMID: 354147  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Cancer Treat Rep. 1978 Apr;62(4):499-504.\n\nA possible new approach to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: massive\ndoses of medroxyprogesterone acetate.\n\nPannuti F, Martoni A, Lenaz GR, Piana E, Nanni P.\n\nThe results obtained with a new hormone therapy using medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MAP) in previously untested single and total doses in the treatment of advanced \nbreast cancer are reported. Fifty-two postmenopausal patients were treated with\nan average total dose of 40 g of MAP for a period of 30 days. Nineteen of 44\npatients (43%) had complete or partial remission, while the disease remained\nunchanged in nine of 44 patients (20%). Disease progression occurred in 12 of 44 \npatients (27%). Partial or complete remission occurred in 12 of 18 (67%) and four\nof six (67%) of the patients with dominant osseous and soft tissue metastases\nrespectively. Three of ten (16%) of those with visceral metastases had remission.\nThe average duration of remission was 7 months. Average survival times were 15.5 \nmonths for patients with remission, 8 months for those with no change, and 2.5\nmonths for those with disease progression. From a subjective standpoint, pain was\nreduced significantly or disappeared in 34 of 36 patients (94%); this was also\nthe case with respect to dyspnea (13 of 16 patients [81%]), anorexia (24 of 29\n[83%]), asthenia (28 of 35 [80%]), and walking impairment (15 of 24 [63%]). When \nrelapse occurred, patients previously treated with massive doses of MAP received \nfurther treatment with higher doses of MAP; four of 22 (18%) of the patients\nattained partial remission once again. Positive effects were also seen in\nsubjective performance status, body weight, and EKG. We also describe the new\nclinical and toxicologic features of this treatment.\n\nPMID: 350387  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A \nphase II investigation.\n\nMattsson W.\n\nIn a phase II investigation of high dose medroxyprogesterone treatment of\nadvanced and previously with other methods heavily treated patient with mammary\ncarcinoma, 7 of 25 patients had a partial remission with a median duration of 5 +\nmonths. In a further 7 patients the disease became stationary. As measured by\nKarnofsky's scale, a median improvement of 20 points was obtained in these 14\npatients. In 4 of 15 patients who had not responded to Tamoxifen treatment, a\npartial remission occurred following MAP therapy. The patients tolerated MAP\nwell.\n\nPIP: High dosage MAP (medroxyprogesterone acetate) was used in the treatment of\nvery advanced breast cancer. 25 patients were included in the study all of whom\nhad measurable lesions which had been unsuccessfully treated by other methods,\nhormonal or combination chemotherapy. Tables present information on previous\ntreatments, results of pre-MAP therapy examinations, and results of post-MAP\ntherapy examinations. Treatment dosage is explained. Results with this high\nMAP-dosage therapy compare favorably with the rate of remission obtained through \nother primary hormonal therapies by other researchers. Promising results without \nnoteworthy adverse effects were obtained; remissions, however, were short. 7 of\nthe 25 had partial remission with a median duration of 5+ months. Another 7\npatients obtained a stationary status of the disease. Even some patients who had \nnot responded previously to Tamoxifen achieved partial remission with MAP\ntherapy, indicating that the MAP does not operate directly on the tumor cells.\nThe incidence of partial remissions was not adversely affected by previous\ncombination chemotherapy and hormonal treatment. Acceptability of the treatment\nwas good.\nPMID: 162770  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Clinical experience with 44 cases].\n\n[Article in Italian]\n\nAmadori D, Ravaioli A, Barbanti F.\n\nMAP was used in high doses (1 g/die up to a total dose of 45-50 g) in 44 cases of\nadvanced mammary carcinoma (IIIrd and IVth stage of the T.N.M. classification),\nevaluated according to the criteria proposed by CBCG. The excellent tolerance to \nthe drug, even at such high doses, is stressed. Therapeutic responses were best\nin cases of metastasis in the soft and bony tissues and in cases of pulmonary\nmetastasis. It is pointed out that the effectiveness of the treatment is\nparticularly evident in patients in whom the free interval has exceeded two years\nand in patients in the menopause for more than five years. In the light of\nresults obtained, the possibility of introducing the drug into the therapeutic\nstrategy of this condition is discussed.\n\nPMID: 74811  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Cancer Treat Rep. 1976 Mar;60(3):251-3.\n\nResponse to medroxyprogesterone acetate (NSC-26386) as secondary hormone therapy \nfor metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.\n\nKlaassen DJ, Rapp EF, Hirte WE.\n\nWe have treated 40 postmenopausal women with documented metastatic breast cancer \nwith medroxyprogesterone acetate. The average age was 63 years and the patients\nwere, on the average, 14 years' postmenopausal. Only two patients had received no\nprior additive hormone therapy. The remainder had previously received estrogen,\nandrogens, or both. Only two patients had objective evidence of tumor regression.\nIn one patient a metastatic node disappeared for 7+ months, and the other patient\nhad well-documented clinical improvement and control of brain mestastases for 22 \nmonths. Two other patients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases\n(regression of some but not all lesions), lasting 3 and 4 months respectively.\nFive other patients had obvious subjective benefit. There were four objective\nresponses (10%) and five subjective responses (12%). There was no correlation\nbetween route of administration and response. All patients receiving benefit had \npreviously responded to other hormones. Side effects were usually absent or\nconsisted of mild fluid retention; however, four patients had disease stimulation\nfrom therapy.\n\nPIP: Progesterone, like estrogens, is used in the treatment of metastatic breast \ncancer. The 3 most active derivatives are megestrol, norethisterone acetate, and \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). This study evaluates the use of MPA in\ntreating metastatic breast cancer in 40 postmenopausal women (average age, 63\nyears; average duration of postmenopause, 14 years) who have either not responded\nto or have relapsed after therapy with estrogens and androgens. 18 patients\nreceived a depot preparation of MPA intramuscularly in a loading dose of 3.2 g\nover a 2-week period and then 400 mg at 2-4 week intervals. 22 patients received \nthe drug orally in a dose of 200 to 300 mg daily. Patients were evaluated after 6\nweeks of therapy. Criteria for evaluating response were those used by the Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group. Only 2 of 40 patients exhibited an objective response\n(disappearance of metastatic lymph node for 9 months in 1 and well-documented\nclinical improvement and control of brain metastases for 22 months in another). 2\npatients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases (regression of some but not\nall lesions) lasting 3 and 4 months respectively. 5 patients had obvious\nsubjective response (pain relief) but no objective response. Overall response\nrate was 22%: 4 objective responses (10%) and 5 subjectives responses (12%).\nRoute of administration did not correlate with response. Tumor stimulation and\nclinical deterioration occurred in 4 patients. It appears that MPA therapy is\ncostly and of minimal usefulness as secondary therapy in metastatic breast\ncancer. Further studies should focus on megestrol and norethisterone acetate\nwhich have been documented to have better response rates.\nPMID: 1260780  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Electronic address:\nsarah.ferguson@uhn.ca.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Oral progestin is an alternative to hysterectomy for women with\ncomplex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) or grade one endometrial cancer (G1EC) who\nwish fertility preservation. We evaluated treatment efficacy and fertility\noutcomes in this population.\nMETHODS: Women <45 y treated with oral progestin for CAH or G1EC were identified \nfrom two cancer centers. Data were obtained from medical records and telephone\nquestionnaires. Time until complete response (CR), and from CR until recurrence\nwas censored for patients without events and analyzed for associations with\npatient and treatment characteristics; cumulative incidence functions were used\nto estimate event probability over time.\nRESULTS: 44 patients were identified, 19 (43%) with CAH and 25 (57%) with G1EC.\nMedian age was 36.5 y (26-44). 24 (55%) achieved CR (median time: 5.7 months).\nOlder age was associated with a lower likelihood of CR (HR 0.84, p=0.0003, 95%\nCI, 0.8-0.9). CR probability appeared to plateau after 12 months of therapy.\nAmong those with CR, 13 (54%) recurred (median time 3.5 y). 24 patients (55%)\nunderwent hysterectomy; 3 (13%) were upstaged. 11 (25%) underwent fertility\ntreatment with the following outcomes: 6 (55%) no pregnancy, 2 (18%) at least one\nlive infant, and 3 (27%) spontaneous abortion. One achieved a live birth without \nintervention.\nCONCLUSION: Oral progestin is an effective temporizing fertility-sparing\ntreatment for women with CAH/G1EC. Fertility specialist involvement is\nrecommended due to the low live birth rate without intervention. Progestin\ntherapy should be re-evaluated at 1 year in non-responders due to a low\nprobability of success. Hysterectomy is recommended after childbearing due to a\nhigh recurrence rate.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nPMID: 24561246  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Follow-up was performed\nprimarily with imaging techniques followed by endometrial biopsy when indicated.\nRESULTS: The median age was 30 years (range, 23-40 years). Fourteen patients\n(29.2%) received daily oral megestrol acetate (median dose 160 mg per day, range \n40-240 mg per day) and 34 (70.8%) received daily oral medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(median dose 500 mg per day, range 80-1,000 mg per day). Complete responses were \nobserved for 37 patients (77.1%) after the median treatment duration of 10 months\n(range 3-20 months). Complete response rates were 76.5%, 73.9%, and 87.5% for\npatients with stage IA, grade 2-3 without myometrial invasion (n=17), for\npatients with stage IA, grade 1 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=23), and \nfor patients with stage IA, grade 2-3 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=8),\nrespectively (P=.731). Recurrence rates for 37 patients who achieved complete\nresponse after a median follow-up time of 48 months (range 7-136 months) were\n23.1%, 47.1%, and 71.4%, respectively (P=.104). None experienced disease\nprogression or died of the disease. Nine patients gave birth to 10 healthy\nnewborns.\nCONCLUSION: Progestin treatment appears to be reasonably effective for patients\nwith stage IA, grade 2-3 differentiation without myometrial invasion and patients\nwith stage IA grade 1 differentiation with superficial myometrial invasion.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.\n\nPMID: 23743459  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub\n2009 Dec 4.\n\nEfficacy of venlafaxine, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate for\nthe treatment of vasomotor hot flushes in men taking gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone analogues for prostate cancer: a double-blind, randomised trial.\n\nIrani J(1), Salomon L, Oba R, Bouchard P, Mottet N.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Urology Unit, University Hospital, Poitiers, France. j.irani@chu-poitiers.fr\n\nComment in\n    Lancet Oncol. 2010 Feb;11(2):107-8.\n\nBACKGROUND: Hot flushes are the most common complaints reported by men undergoing\nandrogen suppression treatment for prostate cancer. We designed a randomised\ndouble-blind trial to compare the efficacy of three drugs, each of which has\nproven effective for preventing hot flushes in previous studies.\nMETHODS: Men with prostate cancer with an indication for androgen suppression\nwere enrolled in the study at 106 urology centres in France between April 14,\n2004, and April 20, 2007. All patients were treated for 6 months with leuprorelin\n(11.25 mg). At month 6, patients who spontaneously asked for treatment, or those \nwho presented with 14 hot flushes or more during the week before the visit, were \nrandomly assigned to either venlafaxine 75 mg daily, medroxyprogesterone acetate \n20 mg daily, or cyproterone acetate 100 mg daily. All patients received two\nindistinguishable pills in the morning and one in the evening from week 1 to week\n8, and one indistinguishable pill in the morning from week 9 to week 10, to\ncomply with the double-blind design. Random assignment with a block size of three\nwas done centrally, by fax, and each patient was given a randomisation number.\nThe allocation sequence was stratified by centre. Assessment was done at\ninclusion, at randomisation, and then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after\nrandomisation. Participants completed a daily hot-flush diary for 1 week, and a\nquality of life questionnaire before each visit throughout the study. The primary\noutcome was the change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation and \n1 month. All patients who received at least one study treatment dose were\nincluded in the efficacy analysis. This trial is registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01011751.\nFINDINGS: Of the 919 men initially enrolled, 311 were randomly assigned to one of\nthe study treatments at 6 months: 102 to venlafaxine, 101 to cyproterone, and 108\nto medroxyprogesterone. 309 patients were included in the efficacy analysis,\nsince two were excluded for protocol deviations (one in the cyproterone and one\nin the medroxyprogesterone group; both were excluded because they were already\nundergoing treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants at\nrandomisation). The change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation \nand 1 month was -47.2% (IQR -74.3 to -2.5) in the venlafaxine group, -94.5%\n(-100.0 to -74.5) in the cyproterone group, and -83.7% (-98.9 to -64.3) in the\nmedroxyprogesterone group. The decrease from baseline was significant for all\nthree groups (p<0.0001). Pairwise comparison of treatment groups adjusted by the \nBonferroni method confirmed that the decreases in hot-flush score were\nsignificantly larger in the cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone groups than in\nthe venlafaxine group, regardless of the interval considered (p<0.0001 in all\ncases). There was no significant difference between the cyproterone and\nmedroxyprogesterone groups (p>0.2 in all cases). Serious side-effects occurred in\nfour, seven, and five patients in the venlafaxine, cyproterone, and\nmedroxyprogesterone groups, respectively, of which none, one (dyspnoea), and one \n(urticaria) were considered related to the drug, respectively.\nINTERPRETATION: After 6 months of treatment with leuprorelin, venlafaxine,\ncyproterone, and medroxyprogesterone proved to be effective in reducing hot\nflushes. However, the hormonal treatments cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone\nwere significantly more effective than venlafaxine. As cyproterone is a\nrecognised treatment in prostate cancer, and its use could interfere with\nhormonal therapy, medroxyprogesterone could be considered to be the standard\ntreatment for hot flushes in men undergoing androgen suppression for prostate\ncancer.\nFUNDING: Takeda Laboratories, Puteaux, France.\n\nCopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, graphic display of time-to-event data usually takes the form \nof a Kaplan-Meier survival plot. Kaplan-Meier plots, however, make differences\nbetween groups seem larger than they really are. To overcome these limitations,\nwe developed a technique for producing scatter plots with survival data and\napplied it to data from a randomized trial of patients with renal cancer. As of\nJune 21, 2001, 25 of the 347 patients with kidney cancer in the Medical Research \nCouncil RE01 randomized treatment trial for whom data were available had been\ncensored, and the remainder had died. Values of the censored survival times were \nimputed by assuming a log-normal distribution in survival times and by drawing a \nrandom sample given that that each patient with censored data survived at least\nto the point of censoring. The combined original and imputed data were then\nexamined by use of dot plots and scatter plots. In the RE01 trial, median\nsurvival of patients treated with interferon was 3.0 months (95% confidence\ninterval = 0.3 to 5.5 months) longer than that in patients treated with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed clear separation\nbetween treatment groups and between prognostic groups. In contrast, comparisons \nof individual observed and imputed survival times between groups of patients\nshowed considerable overlap and gave a more realistic idea of the modest\nbetween-group differences than Kaplan-Meier comparisons. These graphs of the\ndistribution of survival times for individuals in each study group, which are\nsimple to produce, may usefully complement Kaplan-Meier plots.\n\nPMID: 18182621  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The Programme Etude Rein Cytokines (PERCY)\nQuattro trial was designed to evaluate both cytokines for their survival benefit \nto intermediate prognosis patients, who represent the majority of candidates for \nthese treatments.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized in a 2-by-2 factorial design to\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate 200 mg daily, interferon-alfa 9 million IU 3 times a \nweek, subcutaneous interleukin-2 9 million IU daily, or a combination of both\ncytokines. Tumor response was evaluated at Week 12 and Month 6; progression-free \npatients received further identical treatment for a maximum of 3 additional\nmonths. Primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints were\ndisease-free survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life. Survival was\nanalyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nRESULTS: From January 2000 to July 2004, 492 patients were enrolled. Analysis was\nperformed after a 29.2-month median follow-up (range, 0 months to 54.6 months).\nThere were no significant survival differences between the 244\ninterferon-alfa-treated patients and 248 noninterferon-alfa patients (hazard\nratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81-1.24) or between the 247 interleukin-2 and 245\nnoninterleukin-2-treated patients (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87-1.33; log\nrank, 0.99 and 0.52, respectively). Grade 3-4 toxicities were significantly more \nfrequent in cytokine-treated patients than in medroxyprogesterone-treated\npatients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous interleukin-2 and/or interferon-alfa provide no\nsurvival benefit in metastatic renal cancers of intermediate prognosis, and they \ninduce a significant risk of toxicity. Newly available angiogenesis inhibitors\nshould be preferred for these patients.\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 American Cancer Society.\n\nPMID: 17932908  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the\nthalidomide arm, there was no objective response seen. The best response was SD\nin three patients lasting 5+, 6+, and 12 months, respectively. All patients in\nthe medroxyprogesterone arm progressed. There was no difference in overall\nsurvival between the two arms; median survival in the thalidomide arm was 8.2\nmonths compared with 4.8 months in the medroxyprogesterone arm (P = .62). Hazard \nratio was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.94). Median duration of treatment was 73 days\n(range, 14 to 364 days) in the thalidomide arm, and 84 days (range, 7 to 175\ndays) in the medroxyprogesterone arm. The high incidence of toxicity in the\nthalidomide arm, mainly somnolence, constipation, fatigue and paraesthesia, meant\nthat only 30.8% of patients were able to tolerate the maximum dose of 400 mg/d of\ntreatment.\nCONCLUSION: Thalidomide is not superior to medroxyprogesterone acetate in\npatients with metastatic RCC. Its risk/benefit ratio does not favor its use in\nthis patient population.\n\nPMID: 16484699  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A new approach to the investigation of interactions.\n\nRoyston P(1), Sauerbrei W, Ritchie A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Cancer Division, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, 222 Euston Road, London NW1 2DA, UK.\npr@ctu.mrc.ac.uk\n\nThe first analysis of the MRC RE01 trial in metastatic renal carcinoma identified\na 28% reduction in the hazard of death for patients treated with interferon-alpha\ncompared with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). No subgroup was identified in\nwhich treatment with interferon-alpha was more or less effective than MPA. We\nused a new approach based on fractional polynomials to investigate the updated\ndata from this trial for the possible interaction of treatment with prognostic\nfactors. In the spirit of hypothesis generation, we considered 10 possible\nprognostic variables, of which white cell count (WCC) was found to influence the \neffectiveness of interferon treatment. In patients treated with MPA, there was no\nprognostic effect of WCC, whereas, in patients treated with interferon, the risk \nof dying increased significantly with WCC level. We defined subgroups of patients\nbased on WCC levels and estimated a hazard ratio of 0.53 in favour of interferon \nin patients with WCC <6.5 x 10(9), whereas for patients with WCC >10 x 10(9) the \nrisk appears to be similar between the treatment groups, or even slightly raised \nin the interferon group. Since our results are derived from flexible statistical \nmodels, they may be interpreted as a new hypothesis and require validation in\nindependent data.\n\nPMCID: PMC2410187\nPMID: 14970855  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Roffo Cancer Institute, University of Buenos\nAires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nComment in\n    J Pain Symptom Manage. 2004 Sep;28(3):195-7; author reply 197-8.\n\nSystemic syndromes characterized by a persistent activity of circulating\nmediators (cytokines) are frequently present with advanced cancer. We grouped\nunder the general heading of "Systemic Immune-Metabolic Syndrome (SIMS)" a\nparticular variety of distressing systemic syndrome characterized by\ndysregulation of the psycho-neuro-immune-endocrine homeostasis, with overlapping \nclinical manifestations. SIMS may include cachexia, anorexia, nausea, early\nsatiety, fatigue, tumor fever, cognitive changes and superinfection. The aim of\nthis study was to ameliorate some of the SIMS symptoms in a homogeneous group of \nlung adenocarcinoma patients using a multitargeted therapy. Fifteen patients with\nevidence of SIMS were studied. SIMS was defined as the presence of weight loss,\nanorexia, fatigue performance status>/=2 and acute-phase protein response.\nPatients received medroxyprogesterone (MPA) (500 mg twice daily), celecoxib (200 \nmg twice daily), plus oral food supplementation for 6 weeks. After treatment, 13 \npatients either had stable weight (+/- 1%) or had gained weight. There were\nsignificant differences in improvement of body-weight-change rate, nausea, early \nsatiety, fatigue, appetite and performance status. Patients who had any kind of\nlung infection showed higher levels of IL-10 compared to non-infected patients\n(P=0.039). Our results suggest that patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma,\ntreated with MPA, celecoxib and dietary intervention, might have considerable\nimprovement in certain SIMS outcomes. This multitargeted symptomatic approach\ndeserves further study.\n\nPMID: 14711473  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Unfortunately the promising results obtained in biological studies have\nnot yet been confirmed in clinical studies. One reason is linked to the\nimmunosuppression of metastatic patients which is caused by macrophage products. \nIL-6 in particular is considered a growth factor for RCC. Medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) may interfere with IL-6 macrophage production, possibly causing a\nsynergistic effect in association with IL-2 and IFN-alpha. Therefore the purpose \nof our study was to evaluate the toxicity and the efficacy of the association\nbetween IL-2, IFN-alpha and MPA.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with metastatic RCC were\nenrolled. IL-2 was administered subcutaneously at doses of 4.5 million UI on days\n1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26; IFN-alpha was administered s.c. at a dose of 3\nmillion t.t.w; MPA was administered orally at a dose of 1000 mg daily. This\nschedule was repeated after a rest of 2 weeks.\nRESULTS: Toxicity was mild: the main symptoms observed were fatigue and fever.\nSix CR (14%), five PR (12%), thirteen SD (31%) and seventeen PD (41%) were\nobserved for an overall response rate of 26%. Patients with good PS and low\nlevels of CRP had a better prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: Considering both the good activity and the low toxicity of this\nscheme, we think that it could be carried out in normal clinical practice.\n\nPMID: 12530040  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The study\nincluded 34 patients with histologically--confirmed AH and 86--CAC (stage I-II\nand III-IV). All patients were given preoperative "shock therapy" with a\ncombination of progestins and anticoagulants: 500 mg, i.v., 10 days--(AH) and\nwell-differentiated cell CAC; 20 days--moderately- and poorly-differentiated cell\nCAC.

Medical Research Council Renal Cancer Collaborators.\n\n[No authors listed]\n\nComment in\n    Lancet. 1999 Jan 2;353(9146):6-7.\n\nBACKGROUND: Metastatic renal carcinoma has a 2-year survival of around 20% and is\nlargely resistant to chemotherapy. The use of interferons in the treatment of\nmetastatic renal carcinoma remains controversial. Although non-randomised studies\nsuggest that biological therapy with interferons produces a small number of\ntumour responses, most clinicians judge such treatment to be ineffective. We have\ninvestigated the effect of treatment with interferon-alpha on survival in\npatients with metastatic renal carcinoma.\nMETHODS: In a multicentre, randomised trial, patients with metastatic renal\ncarcinoma were randomly assigned subcutaneous interferon-alpha (three doses--5\nMU, 5 MU, 10 MU--for the first week, then 10 MU three times per week for a\nfurther 11 weeks; n=174) or oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 300 mg once\ndaily for 12 weeks; n=176). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis\nwas by intention to treat. The trial used a triangular sequential design for\nearly termination as soon as results were conclusive. The trial was stopped in\nNovember, 1997, when data were available for 335 patients (167 interferon-alpha, \n168 MPA).\nFINDINGS: A total of 111 patients have died in the interferon-alpha group, and\n125 patients have died in the MPA group. There was a 28% reduction in the risk of\ndeath in the interferon-alpha group (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.55-0.94],\np=0.017). Interferon-alpha gave an improvement in 1-year survival of 12% (MPA 31%\nsurvival, interferon-alpha 43%), and an improvement in median survival of 2.5\nmonths (MPA 6 months, interferon-alpha 8.5 months).\nINTERPRETATION: The benefit of treatment with interferon-alpha should be weighed \nagainst the drug's toxic effects. Combination regimens of biological therapy and \nchemotherapy should now be compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in\nrandomised controlled trials.\n\nPMID: 10023944  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There\nwere no objective responders among the eight patients treated with recombinant\ngamma-interferon at an i.v. dose of 1 mg/m(2) daily for five days every other\nweek for four weeks then 1 mg/m(2) three times a week given every other week\nuntil there was documented disease progression or complete response (CR). Overall\nmedian survival was 17.3 months (range 1.4 to 184). The major side effects of\ntreatment included fever/chills (75%), mild anorexia and fatigue (75%),\nnausea/vomiting (80%), leukopenia (38%), and abnormal liver function tests (25%).\nThere were no life-threatening side effects observed. At our institution, in a\nrandom cohort of eight patients with metastatic RCC, recombinant gamma-interferon\nwhen given at a dose of 1 mg/m(2) per day given three times per week on an every \nother week schedule yields no clinical antitumor activity. A review of the\nliterature on the use of gamma-interferon for metastatic RCC suggests that\nlow-dose combination therapy with other cytokines may yield the best\nresponse-to-side effect ratio. Higher doses yield more responses but an added\ncost of more toxicity.\n\nPMID: 8610639  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

WHO Collaborative Study of\nNeoplasia and Steroid Contraceptives.\n\nThomas DB(1), Ray RM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.\n\nA hospital-based case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Bangkok,\nThailand, and in one hospital each in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Mexico City, Mexico\nand Nairobi, Kenya. One purpose of this study was to determine whether the\nlong-acting progestational contraceptive, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(DMPA), alters risk of invasive cervical carcinomas with adenomatous histological\nfeatures. Information on prior use of DMPA, screening for cervical cancer, and\nthe suspected risk factors for this disease was ascertained from interviews of\n239 women with adenocarcinomas and 85 women with adenosquamous carcinomas, as\nwell of from a large pool of controls, 2534 of whom were matched to the cases\nincluded in this report. For selected subsets of these women, a smoking history\nwas also elicited, blood specimens were collected for measurement of antibodies\nagainst herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus, and information on sexual behavior\nwas obtained from interviews of their husbands. The relative risk (and 95%\nconfidence interval) of adenomatous cervical carcinomas in women who ever used\nDMPA was estimated to be 0.75 (0.51, 1.11). No trends in risk were observed with \nduration of DMPA use, times since first or last use, or age at first use. The\nresults provide reassurance that use of DMPA for over four years does not enhance\nrisk of adenomatous cervical carcinomas, and risk is not increased after a\npotential latent period of over 12 years since initial exposure.\n\nPMID: 8585888  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Urology. 1995 May;45(5):758-62.\n\nInterferon alfa and vinblastine versus medroxyprogesterone acetate in the\ntreatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\nKriegmair M(1), Oberneder R, Hofstetter A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Urology, University of Munich, Germany.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Since the beginning of the 1980s, when gene technology provided\nsufficient amounts of cytokines, numerous Phase II studies in metastatic renal\ncell carcinoma were carried out mostly with interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) and\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2). So far, no randomized prospective trials including\nuntreated control groups have been reported. We present a prospective study\ncomparing IFN-alpha and vinblastine (VBL) versus medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MPA).\nMETHODS: Immunochemotherapy schedule consists of IFN-alpha 8 million U/day\nsubcutaneously for 3 days per week and VBL 0.1 mg/kg body weight intravenously at\n3-week intervals. MPA was administrated intramuscularly at a dosage of 500\nmg/week. The response rates, toxicities, and actuarial overall survival were\nanalyzed.\nRESULTS: The overall response rate in 41 patients receiving IFN-alpha and VBL\ntreatment was 20.5% (95% confidence interval, 9% to 33%). Four patients reached a\ncomplete and 5 patients reached a partial remission. No remissions were observed \nin 35 patients of the control group. A statistically significant survival benefit\nfor the IFN-alpha and VBL group could not be demonstrated. Excluding fever, mild \nto moderate toxicities were observed. About one third of patients refused the\nproposed schedule due to general malaise and fatigue.\nCONCLUSIONS: A survival benefit or a favorable outcome of patients with\nmetastatic renal cell carcinoma, treated with IFN-alpha and VBL, could not be\ndemonstrated. As judged from this analysis, IFN-alpha and VBL therapy does not\nsufficiently meet the requirements of a palliative treatment of renal cell\ncarcinoma.\n\nPMID: 7747370  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of 211 patients\nrandomized, 207 were evaluable. There was no improvement in response rates, time \nto response, response duration or overall survival as a result of the loading\ndose. When comparing high and low maintenance doses, there was a significant\ndifference in response rates (48% versus 32%; chi 2 = 10.09, df = 2, P = 0.006)\nand survival (66% versus 41% alive at 12 months; chi 2 = 9.06, df = 1, P = 0.003)\nin favour of the higher dose regimen, although there was no significant\ndifference in the duration of response. There was no additional toxicity\nattributable to the loading dose regimen, but side effects were more frequent\nwith the high dose maintenance schedule (141 of 201 adverse effects occurring in \nthese two groups) although the incidence of severe toxicity was similar with both\nhigh dose and low dose treatments.\n\nPMID: 8845325  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Stat Med. 1994 Nov 15;13(21):2249-60.\n\nOn the development of the Medical Research Council trial of alpha-interferon in\nmetastatic renal carcinoma. Urological Working Party Renal Carcinoma Subgroup.\n\nFayers PM(1), Cook PA, Machin D, Donaldson N, Whitehead J, Ritchie A, Oliver RT, \nYuen P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)MRC Cancer Trials Office, Cambridge, U.K.\n\nThis paper describes the steps taken by the British Medical Research Council\n(MRC) in developing the MRC RE01 trial, a randomized clinical trial for patients \nwith metastatic renal cancer; we discuss the reasons for adopting a triangular\nsequential design and the impact that this has upon the monitoring of the trial. \nIt had been suggested to the MRC that a trial of biological agents for metastatic\nrenal carcinoma should be initiated. The Cancer Therapy Committee (CTC) of the\nMRC, through its associated site specific working parties, is responsible for\ndesigning and co-ordinating randomized trials of alternative treatments in cancer\nin solid tumours. Since no MRC working party for renal carcinoma existed at that \ntime, development began by the formation of an ad hoc group set up under the\nauspices of the CTC. They assessed, by means of a postal questionnaire, U.K.\ninterest in the trials of, and modalities utilized for, treatment of renal\ncancer. The responses focused attention on the important questions to ask and\nindicated the level of potential collaboration. These responses and related\nclinical and statistical issues suggested a protocol to compare\nmedroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) against alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In view \nof the special problems of comparing an expensive and potentially toxic therapy\nwith an inexpensive and non-toxic standard, a sequential design was used rather\nthan a fixed sample size design. Statistical issues raised and solutions provided\nare described. The method of establishing the trial data monitoring committee and\na brief review of mortality from renal carcinoma in England and Wales are also\nincluded. The trial opened to patient recruitment on 1 January 1992. The formal\nstatements regarding statistical issues that appear in the formal trial protocol \n(RE01) are set out in the Appendix.\n\nPMID: 7846423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Tumori. 1993 Aug 31;79(4):246-9.\n\nImmunoendocrine therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MPA): a randomized study with or without MPA in metastatic renal cancer patients\nduring IL-2 maintenance treatment after response or stable disease to IL-2\nsubcutaneous therapy.\n\nLissoni P(1), Barni S, Tancini G, Brivio F, Cardellini P, Vaghi M, Fossati V,\nFrigerio F.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Radiation Oncology, San Gerado Hospital, Monza, Milan, Italy.\n\nAIMS AND BACKGROUND: It is known that interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated cytotoxic\nlymphocytes require a cell-cell contact to exert their anticancer action.\nTherefore, the pronounced fibrosis that generally characterizes the neoplastic\nmass could counteract the action of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Some preliminary\nstudies have shown that progesterone and its analogs may inhibit fibroblast\nproliferation. On the basis of such evidence, we have designed a clinical study\nwith or without the progestational agent medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in\nmetastatic renal cancer patients in maintenance therapy with IL-2 following\nresponse or stable disease (SD) after two cycles of IL-2 subcutaneous\nimmunotherapy, in an attempt to evaluate the influence of MPA on free-from\nprogression (FPP) period.\nMETHODS: The study included 30 consecutive patients who were randomized to\nreceive IL-2 alone (3 million IU twice/day for 5 days/month subcutaneously) or\nIL-2 plus low-dose MPA (500 mg orally one day/week) without interruption until\ndisease progression.\nRESULTS: A FPP period longer than 1 year was obtained in 8/14 patients treated\nwith IL-2 plus MPA and in only 3/16 patients treated with IL-2 alone. The\ndifference was statistically significant. On the contrary, no significant\ndifference was seen in the mean number of lymphocytes and eosinophils, which was \nevaluated monthly. Finally, no hyperglycemic or thromboembolic complications\noccurred in patients concomitantly treated with MPA.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study would suggest that the concomitant\nadministration of low-dose MPA may prolong the FFP period in metastatic renal\ncancer patients under maintenance therapy with IL-2. A longer follow-up will be\nrequired to evaluate the influence of MPA on overall survival.\n\nPMID: 8249176  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thirty patients with unresectable HCC were\nrandomly divided into two groups. A catheter was inserted into the hepatic artery\nof all patients. The first group (group A) was administered 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin\n(CDDP) on day 15 and 13 mg/m2 of Adriamycin (ADM) on day 1 and 8 postoperatively \nvia the hepatic artery cannula; in addition, a daily dose of 150 mg\n5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered orally. Tamoxifen (TAM) 25 mg/m2 daily and\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 400 mg/m2 daily were also administered orally. \nTAM and MPA administration were alternated every 4 weeks. For the second group\n(group B) the same protocol of anticancer drugs administration, without the\nhormonal agents, was given. At least three courses of the treatments were carried\nout. Twelve patients in group A and 14 in group B were evaluated. Partial\nresponse of the hepatic tumor to the treatments was observed in 33.3% of group A \npatients and 21.4% of group B patients, a difference that was not statistically\nsignificant. The 1-year survival rate was 44.5% in group A and 33.0% in group B. \nThe performance status of 25% of the patients in group A was significantly\nimproved compared with 14.3% in group B (p < 0.05). TAM- and MPA-combined\nchemotherapy may not prolong the survival of patients with HCC, although it\nimproves their quality of life.\n\nPMID: 8393272  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Recently, interferon\nalpha (IFN alpha) was used for treatment of this disease in several studies which\nalso demonstrated response rates of 15%. In order to test whether IFN therapy\ncombined with hormones would result in higher response rates we compared single\nagent IFN therapy with a combined therapy of rIFN alpha 2C plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in a randomized multicenter trial. The rIFN\nalpha 2C (2MU) was given s.c. 5 times per week for 8-12 weeks and subsequently\nonce weekly until week 48. In the combined treatment, 750 mg MPA was given p.o.\ndaily until week 48 in addition to the IFN as described. The overall response\nrate in 93 evaluable patients was 5.4% corresponding to 2 complete and 3 partial \nresponses. Median survival was 7 months in both treatment groups. These data\nconfirm the ineffectivity of low IFN doses for treatment of RCC. The low response\nrate is not increased by addition of MPA to IFN.

However, multicenter trials require strong efforts for quality\nassurance concerning admission, treatment and follow-up, thus a highly developed \ncoordinating center is needed. Data on recruitment and protocol compliance, i.e. \ndeviations from the study protocol, are presented for the study of the treatment \nof metastatic renal cell carcinoma and discussed with respect to their impact on \nthe results of the study. 102 patients were randomized either for IFN alpha-2C or\nIFN alpha-2C plus medroxyprogesteroneacetate. 16% of the patients violated\ninclusion criteria and essential data were missing in 16% of the patients.\nOverall treatment results (remission rate of 5.6%, median survival time of 7\nmonths) and the data on adverse events have been biased by lack of protocol\ncompliance. However, the results concerning the lack of differences between\ntreatments remain valid.\n\nPMID: 2954005  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

J Clin Oncol. 1986 Sep;4(9):1365-73.\n\nA trial of combination chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy for previously\nuntreated metastatic carcinoma of the prostate.\n\nSeifter EJ, Bunn PA, Cohen MH, Makuch RW, Dunnick NR, Javadpour N, Bensimon H,\nEddy JL, Minna JD, Ihde DC.\n\nWe administered combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and \ncisplatin to 25 previously untreated patients with metastatic prostate cancer in \norder to assess the efficacy of chemotherapy before any hormonal manipulation.\nHormonal therapy was administered only after progression of disease to\nchemotherapy. All 25 patients were followed until time of death and all were able\nto receive hormonal therapy. We did not find substantially improved response\nrates when combination chemotherapy was applied before endocrine treatment since \nthe 33% objective response rate to chemotherapy was only minimally higher than\nthe response in our patients who had failed hormonal therapy and then received\nidentical or similar chemotherapy. Furthermore, the introduction of intensive\ncombination chemotherapy before hormonal therapy in our study did not result in\nany striking improvement in overall survival compared with patients who received \ninitial hormonal therapy in many other studies. Responses to chemotherapy were\nnot attributable to suppression of serum testosterone since all 12 patients with \npartial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) and four of seven patients with no\nresponse (NR) had normal testosterone levels at the time of response assessment. \nThe initial use of chemotherapy did not adversely affect the expected high\npercentage of objective responses (68%) to subsequent hormonal manipulation. The \nfrequency, duration, and quality of responses to hormonal therapy exceeded the\nresponses to chemotherapy. The disappointing responses to chemotherapy reflect\nthe very modest efficacy of even aggressively delivered cytotoxic agents.\n\nPMID: 2943877  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Chemioterapia. 1986 Jun;5(3):164-72.\n\nAn overview of clinical trials with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(HD-MPA) in endocrine-related tumors other than breast cancer.\n\nRobustelli della Cuna G, Zanon P, Pavesi L, Preti P, Prada GA, Decensi A.\n\nHigh-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA) has been successfully employed in \nthe treatment of hormone-related tumors, especially advanced breast cancer.\nHowever, progestins in general and MPA in particular are considered a useful\ntreatment also in other types of tumors such as endometrial, prostatic and renal \ncancer. Furthermore, MPA has been evaluated in tumors which are not classically\nconsidered hormone-related, such as ovarian cancer. Therapy with one of a number \nof progestational agents has been the conventional approach to the management of \nendometrial carcinoma not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy. Among the\nvarious synthetic progestins, MPA has been the most widely employed both by i.m. \nand oral routes, according to a variety of doses and schedules. Objective\nresponses have been obtained in a percentage of women varying between 30 and 50% \nin the different series. While the role of MPA in the palliative treatment of\nadvanced disease is well accepted, opinion is divided on the role of progestins\nin the adjuvant setting. On the basis of available data, it should be concluded\nthat the usefulness of adjuvant therapy with progestins in high risk, early-stage\nendometrial cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated. As far as prostatic\ncancer is concerned, data coming from comparative trials show that MPA is less\neffective than diethylstilbestrol (DES), and therefore should not be considered\nthe first choice for previously untreated patients. However, it can achieve\nresponses in patients who no longer respond or who are refractory to DES, and\nrepresents the treatment of choice for those patients who, due to their\ncardiovascular conditions, cannot be given estrogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250\nWORDS)\n\nPMID: 2941173  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

An interim report of a prospective randomized study.\n\nPizzocaro G, Piva L, Salvioni R, Di Fronzo G, Ronchi E, Miodini P.\n\nFrom July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1983, 136 consecutive patients with category M0\nrenal cell cancer who had undergone transperitoneal radical nephrectomy at 5\ncenters entered a prospective randomized trial to compare 500 mg. adjuvant\nmedroxyprogesterone 3 times a week for 1 year to no treatment. Sex steroid\nhormone receptors also were studied in the renal tumor and in the surrounding\nhealthy parenchyma with the dextran-coated charcoal technique. After a median\nfollowup period of 3 years (range 13 to 60 months) 30 of 121 evaluable patients\n(24.8 per cent) experienced relapse, usually in the lung or bones. Relapses\noccurred in 15 of 58 evaluable patients in the adjuvant treatment group (25.8 per\ncent) and 15 of 63 evaluable controls (23.8 per cent). The disease recurred more \nfrequently (35.1 per cent) in the 57 patients with no receptors in the tumor than\nin the 45 with at least 1 receptor (17.8 per cent). These results were\nindependent of adjuvant therapy. After a median 3-year followup, adjuvant\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate was of no therapeutic benefit in patients who had\nundergone radical nephrectomy and the side effects of the therapy were evident in\nmore than 50 per cent of the patients.\n\nPMID: 2934557  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patients were examined every 4 months.\nIn the non-responders and in those who relapsed, combination therapy with TAM and\nMPA was given. Twenty-four of 45 (53.4%) responded to TAM alone, 27 of 48 (56.2%)\nresponded to MPA alone. Of the responders 23 later relapsed in the TAM group and \n24 in the MPA group and of these 14 (60.8%) and 15 (62.5%), respectively,\nresponded to the combination therapy. Of the original 21 non-responders to MPA\nalone, 10 responded to the combination (47.6%) and 11 (52.4%) did not; the\ncomparable figures for the TAM alone group were 13 (61.9%) and 8 (38.1%),\nrespectively. Survival rates were much higher in the differentiated than in the\nundifferentiated carcinomas. In conclusion, we feel that the efficacy, and the\nfew side-effects of these drugs used alone and particularly when used in\nsequential combination, make them a very attractive treatment for advanced\nendometrial adenocarcinoma.\n\nPMID: 6235140  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After the first year of follow-up, the\nrelapse rate was 13% in the controls (5 of 38 evaluable patients) versus 28% in\nthe MPA treatment group (9 of 32). Sex steroid receptors were studied in both the\ntumor and in the surrounding healthy parenchyma by the dextran-coated charcoal\ntechnique in 52 of 70 clinically evaluable patients. There was no significant\ncorrelation between receptor studies and the relapse rate. Besides, receptors\nwere more often detected in the healthy than in the neoplastic tissue, and values\nrarely exceeded 10 fmol/mg protein.

Results in 71 evaluable patients (according to\nstandardized group criterial) were as follows: 1. The overall remission rate was \n48% (34 out of 71 patients) with no clear-cut statistical difference between the \nthree treatment schedules but a firm trend towards higher remission rate with CYT\n+ FU (58% as compared to 42% with CYT alone). 2. The scheduled "second-look"\noperations were performed in only 5 of 34 patients clinically judged to respond\nto therapy (PR), and does not allow objective surgical monitoring of therapeutic \neffects intraabdominally. 3. The median remission duration varied from 3 months\n(CYT alone) to 6 months (CYT + FU or CYT + GEST), again with only marginal\nstatistical differences. 4. With regard to survival from initiation of\nchemotherapy, no treatment regimen was superior to another. The median survival\nranged from 6.6 months (CYT) to 10.3 months (CYT + GEST). Patients responding to \nchemo-(hormone) therapy (CR + PR + NC) showed a significant prolongation of\nsurvival as compared to those with initial disease progression: median survival\nin "responders" was 11 months and in "non-responders" 2.9 months. A small group\nof 8-10% of all treated patients has survived in documented tumor remission for 4\nyears and more. 5. Toxicity was moderate and consisted mainly of mild temporary\nhematologic depression, tolerable nausea and transient alopecia, with equal\ndistribution in the three treatment regimens. Hemorrhagic cystitis due to CYT was\nobserved only in 3 cases. 6. Progress in remission induction and duration, as\nwell as survival in advanced ovarian cancer, seems to depend on the inclusion of \nnew effective agents (such as adriamycin, hexamethylmelamine and cisplatinum)\nand, most probably, on significantly more intensive treatment.\n\nPMID: 7423163  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1979 Nov 1;135(5):647-50.\n\nA comparison of medroxyprogesterone serum concentrations by the oral or\nintramuscular route in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial\ncarcinoma.\n\nSall S, DiSaia P, Morrow CP, Mortel R, Prem K, Thigpen T, Creasman W.\n\nA randomized study, comparing serum medroxyprogesterone concentrations by the\noral and intramuscular routes, was performed on 22 patients with persistent or\nrecurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma by six institutions of the Gynecologic\nOncology Group. The oral group (11 patients) received cutaneous Provera\n(medroxyprogesterone), 50 mg three times a day, and the intramuscular group (11\npatients) received 300 mg of Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone) weekly for at\nleast 2 months. Serum levels were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours\nafter administration and every day for the first week and weekly thereafter for 8\nweeks. The mean serum levels (nanograms per milliliter) of medroxyprogesterone in\nthe oral group were consistently higher than the corresponding mean levels of the\nintramuscular group. In addition, from the first through eighth weeks, the\nmeasurements (medians) for the oral group were statistically higher than those\nfor the intramuscular group. Although the study indicates a significant increase \nin serum levels achieved by the oral route, the follow-up period of patients\nunder study is too early to evaluate its clinical effectiveness as compared to\nthe intramuscular route.\n\nPIP: 22 patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma being\nseen by the 6 institutions of the Gynecologic Oncology Group were studied in a\nrandomized way to compare serum levels of medroxyprogesterone after oral and\nintramuscular administration. Regimen A, the oral group, consisted of 11 patients\nwho received cutaneous Provera in 50-mg doses 3 times per day; the intramuscular \ngroup, Regimen B, consisted of the other 11 subjects who received 300-mg doses of\nDepo-Provera weekly for at least 2 months. 3 ml of blood was drawn for both\nregimen groups at 0,2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after administration on Day 1, daily\nthereafter for the 1st week, and weekly thereafter for the course of the study.\nMean serum levels of medroxyprogesterone, measured by radioimmoassay in ng/ml,\nwere consistently higher in the oral group than the corresponding mean levels in \nthe intramuscular group. Also, from Weeks 1-8, the medians for the oral group\nwere statistically higher than those for Regimen B. The apparent efficacy of the \noral route is indicated, but its clinical effectiveness remains untested, for\nthis study has limited follow-up time.\nPMID: 507117  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A low order or response was observed, and these agents\nwere not proven effective as treatment for metastatic renal cell cancer.\nPerformance status and a relatively long symptom-free interval from primary tumor\nto metastatic disease were found to be the most prognostically significant\nfactors for survival.\n\nPIP: Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer have an overall 5-year survival\nrate of only 28% to 40% in spite of aggressive surgical treatment. A prospective \nrandomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group used\nmethyl--CCNU (meCCNU), vinblastine, and meCCNU-medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) \nto treat 165 patients with advanced renal cancer. The antitumor activity of the\nsingle-agent and/or combination therapy is analyzed. Patients were classified (as\nto grade of anaplasia of tumor; age; performance status; primary site of\nmetastatic disease; and previous treatment with a progestational agent) and\nrandomly assigned to various treatment protocols as described. Crossover\nrandomization to one of alternate single-agent or combination regimens was\ncarried out after failure with initial therapy. 2 meCCNU regimens were associated\nwith severe hematologic toxicity, vinblastine regimens with neurotoxicity. All\nregimens except the vinblastine-MPA resulted in substantial vomiting. Response\nrate is low (11%) with each regimen. There were no statistically significant\ndifferences in treatment variables or factors among the various regimens.\nPatients capable of normal activity had a significantly higher response rate and \nlonger survival period than nonambulatory or poor performance status patients. A \nrelatively long symptom-free interval from primary tumor to metastatic disease\nwas also associated with better survival rate. More than 50% of patients\nexhibited disease progression with 3 months of initiating the regimens.\nPMID: 356971  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients received continuous sequential estrogen plus\nprogestin (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54). Menopausal symptoms were assessed using\nthe Greene Climacteric Scale at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. \nA new factor analysis of the scale reduced 21 items to 5 factors. The primary\noutcome was improvement of menopausal symptoms throughout the followup period.\nResults were analyzed by the intent-to-treat principle.\nRESULTS: At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were similar in\nboth groups. Fifteen of 21 menopausal symptoms had a prevalence of \xe2\x89\xa550%, with a\nsimilar distribution between groups. Vasomotor factor scores decreased over time \nin both groups (P = 0.002), but in the estrogen plus progestin group the\nreduction was more pronounced than in the placebo group (1.5-2.0 versus 0.35-0.8 \npoints on a scale of 0-6; P = 0.03). Maximum effects were observed among the most\nsymptomatic women. Psychological, subjective-somatic, and organic-somatic factors\nscores also improved along time (P < 0.001), but the treatment and placebo arms\nimproved to a similar degree. Thromboses occurred in 3 patients receiving\nestrogen plus progestin and in 1 patient receiving placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Menopausal symptoms are highly prevalent in peri- and postmenopausal \nlupus patients. Estrogen plus progestin improved vasomotor symptoms at a\nclinically significant level, but not other menopausal symptoms. Given the\nthrombotic risks of menopausal hormone therapy, this should be used only in women\nwith significant vasomotor symptoms.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nPMID: 22127965  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The 12-month follow-up rate was 82% for the HRT group and 87% for the\nplacebo group.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was occurrence of a severe flare as defined\nby Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus, National Assessment-Systemic Lupus\nErythematosus Disease Activity Index composite.\nRESULTS: Severe flare was rare in both treatment groups: The 12-month severe\nflare rate was 0.081 for the HRT group and 0.049 for the placebo group, yielding \nan estimated difference of 0.033 (P = 0.23). The upper limit of the 1-sided 95%\nCI for the treatment difference was 0.078, within the prespecified margin of 9%\nfor noninferiority. Mild to moderate flares were significantly increased in the\nHRT group: 1.14 flares/person-year for HRT and 0.86 flare/person-year for placebo\n(relative risk, 1.34; P = 0.01). The probability of any type of flare by 12\nmonths was 0.64 for the HRT group and 0.51 for the placebo group (P = 0.01). In\nthe HRT group, there were 1 death, 1 stroke, 2 cases of deep venous thrombosis,\nand 1 case of thrombosis in an arteriovenous graft; in the placebo group, 1\npatient developed deep venous thrombosis.\nLIMITATIONS: Findings are not generalizable to women with high-titer\nanticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or previous thrombosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adding a short course of HRT is associated with a small risk for\nincreasing the natural flare rate of lupus. Most of these flares are mild to\nmoderate. The benefits of HRT can be balanced against the risk for flare because \nHRT did not significantly increase the risk for severe flare compared with\nplacebo.\n\nPMID: 15968009  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Tumori. 1979 Oct 31;65(5):563-85.\n\nHigh-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment in advanced breast cancer. \nA review.\n\nGanzina F.\n\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) when employed at high doses (greater than or\nequal to 500 greater than or equal to 1000 mg/day i.m.) can produce objective\nremission with improved survival in about 30% of postmenopausal women with\nadvanced breast cancer resistant to cytotoxic drugs and endocrine therapies. When\nadministered to women not previously treated with chemotherapy, the objective\nremission response rate reached 40%. From available evidence, high dose MPA can\nbe considered a useful agent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in\npostmenopausal women with soft tissue, pulmonary, pleural or osseous involvement \neven when patients have become refractory to prior hormone and cytotoxic\ntherapies. Early results suggest that the response rate can be increased in\npatients with estrogen and/or progesterone-positive receptors. It is note worthy \nthat in a study conducted on postmenopausal women resistant to cytotoxic and/or\nhormonal drugs, the median duration of survival was 13.5 months, while CRs plus\nPRs did not reach the median at 24 months after starting MPA treatment. High dose\nMPA is essentially devoid of major side effects. Relief of pain, increase in\nappetite and body weight, and sense of well being are characteristic features of \nthe improved quality of life under MPA treatment. However, a gluteal abscess\n(from 2% to 20% dose related) is the most frequent side effect. A promising area \nfor future studies is combined therapy using hormonal and cytotoxic agents or\nalternating sequential combinations. Well-designed studies are needed to develop \nmeans for increasing the complete response rate and therefore survival. Recent\nstudies of combined chemo- and hormonal (MPA) therapy have yielded objective\ntumor regressions of 53 to 80% with an increased rate of complete remissions and \nduration of response.\n\nPIP: (MPA) Medroxyprogesterone acetate when employed at high doses (5001000\nmg/day intramuscularly) can produce objective remission with improved survival in\nabout 30% of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer resistant to\ncytotoxic drugs and endocrine therapies. When administered to women not\npreviously treated with chemotherapy, the objective remission response rate\nreached 40%. From available evidence, high dose MPA can be considered a useful\nagent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with\nsoft tissue, pulmonary, pleural, or osseous involvement even when patients have\nbecome refractory to prior hormone and cytotoxic therapies.

S"\n1. Cancer Treat Rep. 1976 Mar;60(3):251-3.\n\nResponse to medroxyprogesterone acetate (NSC-26386) as secondary hormone therapy \nfor metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.\n\nKlaassen DJ, Rapp EF, Hirte WE.\n\nWe have treated 40 postmenopausal women with documented metastatic breast cancer \nwith medroxyprogesterone acetate. The average age was 63 years and the patients\nwere, on the average, 14 years' postmenopausal. Only two patients had received no\nprior additive hormone therapy. The remainder had previously received estrogen,\nandrogens, or both. Only two patients had objective evidence of tumor regression.\nIn one patient a metastatic node disappeared for 7+ months, and the other patient\nhad well-documented clinical improvement and control of brain mestastases for 22 \nmonths. Two other patients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases\n(regression of some but not all lesions), lasting 3 and 4 months respectively.\nFive other patients had obvious subjective benefit. There were four objective\nresponses (10%) and five subjective responses (12%). There was no correlation\nbetween route of administration and response. All patients receiving benefit had \npreviously responded to other hormones. Side effects were usually absent or\nconsisted of mild fluid retention; however, four patients had disease stimulation\nfrom therapy.\n\nPIP: Progesterone, like estrogens, is used in the treatment of metastatic breast \ncancer. The 3 most active derivatives are megestrol, norethisterone acetate, and \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). This study evaluates the use of MPA in\ntreating metastatic breast cancer in 40 postmenopausal women (average age, 63\nyears; average duration of postmenopause, 14 years) who have either not responded\nto or have relapsed after therapy with estrogens and androgens. 18 patients\nreceived a depot preparation of MPA intramuscularly in a loading dose of 3.2 g\nover a 2-week period and then 400 mg at 2-4 week intervals. 22 patients received \nthe drug orally in a dose of 200 to 300 mg daily. Patients were evaluated after 6\nweeks of therapy. Criteria for evaluating response were those used by the Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group. Only 2 of 40 patients exhibited an objective response\n(disappearance of metastatic lymph node for 9 months in 1 and well-documented\nclinical improvement and control of brain metastases for 22 months in another). 2\npatients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases (regression of some but not\nall lesions) lasting 3 and 4 months respectively. 5 patients had obvious\nsubjective response (pain relief) but no objective response. Overall response\nrate was 22%: 4 objective responses (10%) and 5 subjectives responses (12%).\nRoute of administration did not correlate with response. Tumor stimulation and\nclinical deterioration occurred in 4 patients. It appears that MPA therapy is\ncostly and of minimal usefulness as secondary therapy in metastatic breast\ncancer. Further studies should focus on megestrol and norethisterone acetate\nwhich have been documented to have better response rates.\nPMID: 1260780  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We sought to determine\nwhether adding HRT to the medication regimen of postmenopausal women with\nepilepsy was associated with an increase in seizure frequency.\nMETHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the\neffect of HRT on seizure frequency in postmenopausal women with epilepsy, taking \nstable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and within 10 years of their last\nmenses. After a 3-month prospective baseline, subjects were randomized to\nplacebo, Prempro (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate or CEE/MPA) daily, or double-dose CEE/MPA daily for a\n3-month treatment period.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were randomized after completing baseline. The\nsubjects' ages ranged from 45 to 62 years (mean, 53 years; SD, +/-5), and the\nnumber of AEDs used ranged from none to three (median, one). Five (71%) of seven \nsubjects taking double-dose CEE/MPA had a worsening seizure frequency of at least\none seizure type, compared with four (50%) of eight taking single-dose CEE/MPA\nand one (17%) of six taking placebo (p = 0.05). An increase in seizure frequency \nof the subject's most severe seizure type was associated with increasing CEE/MPA \ndose (p = 0.008). An increase in complex partial seizure frequency also was\nassociated with increasing CEE/MPA dose (p = 0.05). Two subjects taking\nlamotrigine had a decrease in lamotrigine levels of 25-30% while taking CEE/MPA.\nCONCLUSIONS: CEE/MPA is associated with a dose-related increase in seizure\nfrequency in postmenopausal women with epilepsy. CEE/MPA may decrease lamotrigine\nlevels.\n\nPMID: 16981859  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Women were randomized to three groups\nof 44 in each, either to get a single shot of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, \nintramuscularly (Group 1), or medroxyprogesterone acetate in a daily dose of 5 mg\norally (Group 2), or the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)\n(Group 3).

Comparing the\ngroups we noted that for the PBAC, there was no statistically significant\ndifference between groups 1 and 2, while group 3 was superior to both groups 1\nand 2 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). Mean duration of menstruation showed\nno differences among the groups. Hemoglobin levels were no statistically\nsignificant differences between groups 1 and 2, while group 3 was superior to\nboth groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: The efficacies of oral and intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate \nin the treatment of menorrhagia were comparable each other, however, the efficacy\nof LNG-IUS was superior to both.\n\nPMID: 18390083  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Contraception. 1997 Nov;56(5):313-6.\n\nEffect of Depo-Provera or Microgynon on the painful crises of sickle cell anemia \npatients.\n\nde Abood M(1), de Castillo Z, Guerrero F, Espino M, Austin KL.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Hematology Section, Social Security Hospital, Madrid.\n\nForty-three homozygous (SS) female sickle cell anemic patients with a history of \nat least one painful crisis per month and desiring a reversible contraceptive\nwere administered DMPA/3 months or Microgynon monthly. A third group of 16\nsurgically sterilized patients served as control. Patients were followed for 1\nyear to assess possible effects of the contraceptives on the patients' painful\ncrises. No changes were observed in any of the groups in the hematological\nparameters. At the end of the study, 70% of the patients receiving DMPA were\npain-free and only 16% of those still reporting painful crises rated them as\nintense. Patients receiving Microgynon also had an amelioration of the painful\ncrises, although at a lower rate; after 12 months, 45.5% still experienced some\ncrises. Although less marked than in the other groups, 50.5% of the control\npatients also reported an improvement of their painful crisis, which may be a\nresult of closer medical care.\n\nPIP: The effects of a combined oral contraceptive (Microgynon 30, containing\nethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) and a progestogen-only injectable\ncontraceptive (Depo-Provera) on the intensity and frequency of painful crises\nwere investigated in 43 homozygous sickle cell anemia patients at the World\nHealth Organization Collaborative Center for Research in Human Reproduction in\nPanama. Only women with a history of at least one painful crisis per month were\nenrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to receive Depo-Provera (n = 13) or\nMicrogynon (n = 14) for 12 months; the remaining 16 patients--surgically\nsterilized controls-- received no treatment. No changes were recorded throughout \nthe study period in any of the three groups in hematological parameters. In\naddition, there were no pregnancies or treatment-related side effects. In the\nDepo-Provera group, the percentage of patients with painful crises diminished\nsteadily from 50% at 3 months to 30% at 12 months. Moreover, 84% of painful\nepisodes experienced by Depo-Provera acceptors were characterized as moderate or \nmild. Among women in the Microgynon group, the rate of painful crises dropped\nfrom 72.7% at 3 months to 45.5% at 12 months. Controls also reported a 50.5%\ndecline in painful crises, presumably as a result of increased individual\nattention from medical staff. These findings suggest that Depo-Provera can be\nsafely and effectively used for contraceptive purposes in sickle cell anemic\npatients, with a concomitant beneficial effect on painful crises.\nPMID: 9437560  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1995 Mar;42(3):279-87.\n\nThe contribution of hypogonadism to the development of osteoporosis in\nthalassaemia major: new therapeutic approaches.\n\nAnapliotou ML(1), Kastanias IT, Psara P, Evangelou EA, Liparaki M, Dimitriou P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The osteoporosis seen in thalassaemia major is of multifactorial\norigin. The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of hypogonadism to \nthe development of this osteoporosis and to assess the efficacy of new sex\nhormone replacement therapy regimens.\nDESIGN AND PATIENTS: Sixty-seven patients were studied: 12 were hypogonadal, 32\nhad been on previous hormone replacement therapy (conjugated oestrogens plus\nmedroxyprogesterone for females, depot testosterone esters for males); 10 had\nreceived continuous courses of treatment and 22 3-monthly on/off courses, and 22 \nwere eugonadal without previous replacement therapy. Twenty-seven of the above\npatients were evaluated prospectively at 16 and 32 months during different\ntherapeutic approaches (12 without treatment, 7 on continuous replacement and 8\non/off schemes followed by continuous therapy during the second observation\nperiod). The continuous schemes comprised either transdermal oestradiol (100\nmicrograms) plus medroxyprogesterone for females or hCG to produce serum\ntestosterone concentrations within normal range, for males.\nMEASUREMENTS: Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) of lumbar\nspine and distal end of radius were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\nRESULTS: Spinal BMD was found to be more than 30% lower than that of controls\nmatched for sex and age with no difference between sexes. Radial BMD was less\nimpaired and showed significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels in males (decrease of \n5.8% +/- 2.3, mean +/- SD) than in females (-14.5 +/- 3.4%, mean +/- SD). In the \nretrospective evaluation it was found that the hypogonadal group had the lowest\n(P < 0.0001) BMD levels (0.62 +/- 0.01, mean +/- SE) and the highest were\nobserved on the continuous replacement group (0.83 +/- 0.04), whereas the values \nof the other groups were similar. In a multiple regression analysis model it was \nfound that only sex steroid levels were related to the BMD measurements (for\noestradiol t = 2.6, P = 0.01 and for testosterone t = 6.5, P = 0.0001), whereas\nparameters related to haemolytic anaemia and desferrioxamine treatment were not. \nIn the prospective study the continuous replacement group increased BMD and BMC\nvalues more than the on/off treatment courses (P = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hypogonadism seems to play an important role in the development of\nosteopenia-osteoporosis in thalassaemia major; continuous hormone replacement\ntherapy with transdermal oestrogen for females or hCG for responding males best\nimproves the bone density parameters.\n\nPMID: 7758233  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Haematological indices remained steady \nduring the placebo phase, but during the medroxyprogesterone-acetate phase fetal \nhaemoglobin, total haemoglobin, red-cell mass, and red-cell survival rose\nsignificantly, and reticulocytes, irreversibly-sickled-cell counts, and total\nbilirubin fell significantly. Painful crises were significantly less frequent\nduring the medroxyprogesterone-acetate than the placebo phase. These results are \ncompatible with an inhibition of in-vivo sickling in patients with SS disease\nduring medroxyprogesterone-acetate treatment. The mechanisms of such an effect\nrequire further study.\n\nPMID: 6178915  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Climacteric. 2004 Mar;7(1):92-102.\n\nWell-being at onset of hormone replacement therapy: comparison between two\ncontinuous combined regimens.\n\nOdmark IS(1), B\xc3\xa4ckstr\xc3\xb6m T, Jonsson B, Bixo M.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Clinical Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ume\xc3\xa5 University,\nUme\xc3\xa5, Sweden.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the effect on well-being of two continuous combined\nhormone replacement therapies (HRTs) in women starting treatment ('starters') and\nwomen switching from mainly sequential HRT ('switchers').\nMETHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, 1-month trial, in which 249\npostmenopausal women were treated with either conjugated estrogen plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (CE/MPA 0.625 mg/5 mg) or 17beta-estradiol plus\nnorethisterone acetate (E2/NETA 2 mg/1 mg) continuously. Twelve items for\nmeasuring climacteric symptoms and well-being were reported daily on a validated \nsymptom scale.\nRESULTS: Women taking CE/MPA reported lower scores for breast tenderness (p =\n0.005), depression (p = 0.019), irritability (p = 0.004) and tension (p = 0.048),\ncompared with women taking E2/NETA. Compared with pretreatment, both groups\ndeveloped side-effects during the first week: breast tenderness, swelling and\ndepression (p < 0.05). Starters, but also switchers, improved in sweats (p <\n0.001 and p = 0.030). Compared with pretreatment ratings, switchers reported\nhigher scores for breast tenderness (p < 0.001), depression (p = 0.050) and\nnegative effects on daily life (p < 0.001), whereas starters reported only\nphysical side-effects (p < 0.05). A history of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\npredicted high scores for swelling (p = 0.023), depression (p = 0.024), tension\n(p = 0.009), irritability (p = 0.027), headache (p < 0.001) and negative effects \non daily life (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: CE/MPA 0.625 mg/5 mg is better tolerated than E2/NETA 2 mg/1 mg, and\nstarters react differently from switchers. Side-effects occur more quickly than\nbenefits with HRT, and are more frequent in women with previous PMS.\n\nPMID: 15259288  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Women with prior hysterectomy received CEE alone (0.625 mg/d)\n(n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895310) or placebo (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895429). The intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years\nin CEE plus MPA trial and 7.2 years in CEE alone trial with 13 years of\ncumulative follow-up until September 30, 2010.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were coronary\nheart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer, respectively. A global index also\nincluded stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip\nfracture, and death.\nRESULTS: During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases\nwere 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI,\n0.95-1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24;\n95% CI, 1.01-1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism,\ndementia (in women aged \xe2\x89\xa565 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary\nincontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor \nsymptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some\nelevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases \nfor CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11-1.48]). The risks and\nbenefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases \nfor CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14) and 104 vs\n135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02);\ncumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer\ndiagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar \nto CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone,\nyounger women (aged 50-59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause\nmortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89.05 for trend\nby age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per\n10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of\n50-59 years to 38 for ages of 70-79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19\nfewer cases for ages of 50-59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70-79 years.\nQuality-of-life outcomes had mixed results in both trials.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Menopausal hormone therapy has a complex pattern of\nrisks and benefits. Findings from the intervention and extended postintervention \nfollow-up of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trials do not support use of this therapy \nfor chronic disease prevention, although it is appropriate for symptom management\nin some women.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMCID: PMC3963523 [Available on 2014/10/2]\nPMID: 24084921  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There were 359\nincident cases of CHD during follow-up. After the exclusion of women with\ncardiovascular disease (n = 90), diabetes, or hypertension at baseline (n = 103),\n166 CHD cases were matched to 524 controls on age, randomization date, and\nhysterectomy status. MetS classification required at least three of five Adult\nTreatment Panel III criteria. Analyses by \xcf\x87 and t tests for heterogeneity and\nlogistic regression were performed. Postmenopausal women (n = 27,347) aged 50 to \n79 years from 40 US clinical centers participated. Daily conjugated equine\nestrogens (0.625 mg) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg; EPT) or conjugated \nequine estrogens (0.625 mg; ET) were compared with placebo. The main outcome\nmeasure was the odds for CHD with HT use versus placebo by MetS status.\nRESULTS: MetS modified the risk of CHD events with HT. In the pooled analysis,\nrisk was increased with HT versus placebo in women with MetS (odds ratio, 2.26;\n95% CI, 1.26-4.07), whereas women without MetS were not found to have an\nincreased risk for a CHD event with HT (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.58-1.61; P\nfor interaction = 0.03). Results of the EPT and ET trials, when examined\nseparately, were similar. The constellation of MetS variables was more predictive\nof risk from HT than MetS components assessed individually. When women with\ndiabetes or hypertension were included in the analysis, statistically significant\neffect modification was not detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: MetS at baseline in women without prior cardiovascular disease,\ndiabetes, or hypertension at baseline identifies women who are more likely to\nhave had adverse coronary outcomes on HT. CHD risk stratification is recommended \nbefore initiating HT. The basis for the greater risk of CHD events with HT among \nwomen with MetS requires further study.\n\nPMID: 23435021  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

However, the risk of venous thrombosis \n(VT) associated with OC use in women over 50 years old has never been assessed\nand the two preparations have not been directly compared.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine and compare the risk of VT associated with OC and HT\nuse.\nMETHODS: From a large case-control study, 2550 women aged over 50 years old, 1082\npatients with a first VT and 1468 controls, were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and \n95% confidence intervals for VT were calculated for OC-users (164 patients and 54\ncontrols) and HT-users (88 patients and 102 controls) compared with non-hormone\nusers (823 patients and 1304 controls).\nRESULTS: OC-users had a 6.3-fold (4.6-9.8) increased risk of VT. This ranged from\n5.4 (3.3-8.9) for preparations containing levonorgestrel to 10.2 (4.8-21.7) for\ndesogestrel. The VT-risk associated with oral HT use was 4.0 (1.8-8.2) for\nconjugated equine estrogen combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate and 3.9\n(1.5-10.7) for micronized estradiol combined with norethisterone acetate.\nNon-oral HT did not increase the risk of VT: OR 1.1 (0.6-1.8). Relative risk\nestimates were further increased in hormone users with factor V Leiden,\nprothrombin G20210A or blood group non-O and hormone users with a family history \nof VT.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, non-oral HT seemed to be the safest hormonal\npreparation in women over 50 years old. OC use increased the VT risk the most,\nespecially in women with inherited thrombophilia or a family history of VT.\n\n\xc2\xa9 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.\n\nPMID: 23136837  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The purpose of this 18-week prospective experimental\nstudy was to compare the impact of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(DMPA-SC) on cardiometabolic markers in obese and normal-weight women.\nMETHODS: Normal-weight [body mass index (BMI) 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)] and obese\n(BMI\xe2\x89\xa530 kg/m(2)) women received injections of 104 mg DMPA-SC at baseline and 12\nweeks later. Markers of cardiometabolic risk measured at baseline and 18 weeks\nafter the first injection included body morphometry, fasting blood tests, and\noral and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGT).\nRESULTS: At baseline, median gravidity, BMI, abdominal circumference, and acute\ninsulin response to intravenous glucose were higher and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL) cholesterol and insulin sensitivity (S(I) from FSIGTs) were lower in the 10\nobese participants than the five normal-weight women (p\xe2\x89\xa4.05 for each). While\nthere was no significant difference between median baseline and follow-up values \namong normal-weight women, the difference between median baseline and follow-up\namong the obese cohort was significantly higher for BMI and lower for HDL\ncholesterol and insulin sensitivity (S(I)) (p\xe2\x89\xa4.05 for each). The absolute changes\nfor routinely measured clinical laboratory values of metabolic decline were no\ndifferent among the normal-weight vs. obese women. The difference in absolute\nchange in \xce\xb2-cell compensation for insulin resistance [disposition index (DI)] was\nsignificant between the two groups at follow-up, with the normal-weight group\nexperiencing an increase in DI while the obese group experienced a decline in DI \n(188.5 vs. -286, p=.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Obese women have an increased baseline cardiometabolic risk when\ncompared with normal-weight women at baseline. There was a significantly greater \ndecline in \xce\xb2-cell compensation for insulin resistance in obese women on DMPA. Our\ndata suggest potential deleterious effects of DMPA on glucose regulation in obese\nwomen. Further studies should elucidate the long-term cardiometabolic\nconsequences of DMPA use in obese women.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV were assessed\nusing 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings at baseline and after hormone\ntherapy.\nRESULTS: At baseline, the cardiac variables were similar in women with and\nwithout hot flashes. In women with hot flashes, the mean 24-hour heart rate and\nnighttime heart rate showed a tendency toward reduction in estradiol-only users\ncompared with those taking placebo and those taking estradiol combined with MPA. \nIn women with hot flashes, oral estradiol versus transdermal estradiol reduced\nnighttime HRV in the time domain (triangular index, -27 \xc2\xb1 36 vs +8 \xc2\xb1 36, P =\n0.042). In women without hot flashes, the use of oral estradiol with MPA reduced \ntime-domain HRV (SD of all normal-to-normal intervals; -11 \xc2\xb1 13 ms, P = 0.048,\nand square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between\nadjacent normal-to-normal intervals; -6 \xc2\xb1 8 ms, P = 0.036). The women with hot\nflashes had more supraventricular ectopic beats when using oral estradiol with\nMPA than when using oral estradiol only (71 \xc2\xb1 128 vs 12 \xc2\xb1 11, P = 0.018).\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral estrogen, especially when combined with MPA, may have adverse\neffects on HRV in women with and without hot flashes, whereas transdermal\nestradiol showed no such effects. Furthermore, women with hot flashes receiving\noral estrogen combined with MPA are possibly more prone to cardiac arrhythmias\nthan are women using estrogen only.\n\nPMID: 21934534  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However,\nevidence has emerged indicating a phasic rather than linear progression with\ntime. A major reason for this non-linear pattern appears to be the occurrence of \nhemorrhages in the arterial wall, although data on this issue are still scarce.\nWe studied the occurrence of temporarily impressive thickenings of the carotid\narterial wall in a cohort of healthy postmenopausal women who were followed up\nfor 3 years with regular carotid ultrasound examinations.\nMETHODS: The women were the European participants of a randomized\nplacebo-controlled trial into the effect of hormone replacement therapy on\nprogression of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). For a period of 3 years,\nthe women underwent a standardized carotid ultrasound protocol every 6 months.\nCommon, bifurcation and internal carotid segments were scanned on both sides,\nstored on videotape, and the near and far wall CIMT was measured on defined\nangles and segments, also in areas of plaque. Adverse events were routinely\nrecorded. At the completion of the study, all segment-specific measurements were \nevaluated for outliers. Images were retrieved from videotape and evaluated\nwhether the outlier resulted from a real morphological change or 'measurement\nerror'.\nRESULTS: The 509 healthy postmenopausal women, free from previous symptomatic\ncardiovascular disease, underwent 3,812 carotid ultrasound scans during the\nstudy, and 44,924 carotid segments were evaluated. In 203 segments of 188\nparticipants outliers were observed. True morphological changes were found in 12 \nparticipants, equivalent to a 3-year risk of 2.4%. These changes did not give\nrise to clinical symptoms. In the 6 women of whom we had follow-up measurements, \nthe changes were reversed within 6-12 months.\nCONCLUSION: We observed acute increases in CIMT among 2.4% of healthy\npostmenopausal European women followed for 3 years. When assuming these were the \nresult of vessel wall hemorrhages, our findings add to the body of evidence\nsuggesting that vessel wall hemorrhages contribute to atherosclerosis development\nand also appear to occur clinically silent.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 S.

We compared the responses of biochemical\nmarkers for cardiovascular diseases to HT in recently postmenopausal women with\ntolerable or intolerable hot flushes.\nMETHODS: Healthy, non-smoking freshly postmenopausal women (n = 150) with no\nprevious HT use were studied. Seventy-two women reported intolerable hot flushes \n(> or =7 moderate/severe episodes/day) and 78 women tolerable hot flushes (< or\n=3 mild episodes/day). The participants were treated in randomized order with\neither transdermal estradiol gel (1 mg), oral estradiol valerate (2 mg) with or\nwithout medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg), or placebo for 6 months.\nTreatment-induced changes in lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, sex hormone\nbinding globulin (SHBG) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were compared.\nThe trial is registered in the US National Institutes of Health Clinical Research\nRegistry (no. NCT00668603).\nRESULTS: Pretreatment hot flush status was not related to the responses of these \nmarkers to different forms of HT. However, when all active regimens were\nevaluated together as a post-hoc analysis, 7/10 markers showed a tendency toward \ngreater beneficial changes in women with intolerable hot flushes. Furthermore, in\nwomen with intolerable hot flushes and with HT use, the increases in SHBG\n(Spearman's rho = - 0.570, p < 0.001) were related to the reductions in hot\nflushes during the use of HT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hot flushes appear to be no significant determinant for the\nresponses of vascular markers to HT use.\n\nPMID: 20443719  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

After 12 months, the women assigned to MPA had lesser increases \nin BMI (p=0.04), triglyceride (p=0.003), HDL (p<0.0005), SHBG (p<0.0005), total\ntestosterone (p=0.003), and CRP values (p=0.01) and higher serum albumin levels\n(p<0.0005) compared with the women receiving CEE.\nCONCLUSION: Therapy with CEE, but not MPA, after surgical menopause appears to\npredispose healthy women to low-grade inflammation, as evidenced by its\nindependent associations with elevated CRP and reduced albumin levels. In women\ntreated with MPA, the favorable levels of inflammatory markers, BMI, and\ntriglyceride levels need to be confirmed in larger controlled trials, as\nprogesterone therapy may provide a safe and effective alternative to estrogen for\nvasomotor symptoms in women with surgical menopause.\n\nPMID: 20411996  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a\nserine protease that accumulates in unstable atherosclerotic plaques. FSAP is\npresumably involved in plaque stability and rupture. Reduced plasma concentration\nof FSAP may be associated with the development and expression of atherosclerosis \nand may thus contribute to precipitation of CHD. Here we address the potential\ninfluence of various HT regimens on plasma measures of FSAP in postmenopausal\nwomen treated for 1 year with different HT formulations or no HT.\nMETHODS: Six groups of postmenopausal women (n = 139) were allocated to five\ndifferent HT modalities or no HT. Samples were collected at baseline and after 12\nmonths of treatment. Prototype assays were used for the determination of FSAP\nantigen and FSAP activity.\nRESULTS: The FSAP measures were comparable at baseline. No significant changes\nwere observed in the control group after 12 months. HT in general induced a\nsignificant increase in FSAP antigen (7.7 microg/ml at baseline and 8.0 microg/ml\nafter 12 months, p = 0.05), FSAP activity (1.54 PEU/ml at baseline and 1.68\nPEU/ml after 12 months, p < 0.001) and FSAP ratio (202 mPEU/microg at baseline\nand 210 mPEU/microg after 12 months, p = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: HT increases the plasma measures of FSAP. This increase may\ncontribute to the protective effect on CHD induced by HT in younger\npostmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 20222844  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, this increased risk might be\nlimited to the first years of use and to women who start therapy late in\nmenopause.\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of continuous estrogen plus progestin therapy\non CHD risk over time and stratified by years since menopause.\nDESIGN: Women's Health Initiative randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled \ntrial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00000611)\nSETTING: 40 U.S. clinical centers.\nPATIENTS: 16 608 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus at baseline from 1993\nto 1998.\nINTERVENTION: Conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone\nacetate, 2.5 mg/d, or placebo.\nMEASUREMENTS: Adherence-adjusted hazard ratios and CHD-free survival curves\nestimated through inverse probability weighting.\nRESULTS: Compared with no use of hormone therapy, the hazard ratio for continuous\nuse of estrogen plus progestin therapy was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.55 to 3.62) for the\nfirst 2 years and 1.69 (CI, 0.98 to 2.89) for the first 8 years. For women within\n10 years after menopause, the hazard ratios were 1.29 (CI, 0.52 to 3.18) for the \nfirst 2 years and 0.64 (CI, 0.21 to 1.99) for the first 8 years, and the CHD-free\nsurvival curves for continuous use and no use of estrogen plus progestin crossed \nat about 6 years (CI, 2 years to 10 years).\nLIMITATION: The analysis may not have fully adjusted for joint determinants of\nadherence and CHD risk. Sample sizes for some subgroup analyses were small.\nCONCLUSION: No suggestion of a decreased risk for CHD was found within the first \n2 years of estrogen plus progestin use, including in women who initiated therapy \nwithin 10 years after menopause. A possible cardioprotective effect in these\nwomen who initiated therapy closer to menopause became apparent only after 6\nyears of use.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nPMCID: PMC2936769\nPMID: 20157135  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Blood pressure (office and ambulatory), heart rate and\nheart rate variability (HRV) were measured at baseline and following EPT/placebo \ntreatment. In eight women, we used a wire-myograph to assess endothelial function\nand contractile response of subcutaneous arteries to transmural nerve stimulation\n(TNS) and exogenous noradrenaline.\nRESULTS: EPT decreased vascular reactivity to cumulative TNS compared with\nbaseline (p<0.01) and placebo (p<0.05). Moreover, EPT diminished sensitivity to\nexogenous noradrenaline (p<0.05). Although EPT reinforced response to\nacetylcholine, we observed no difference in maximal relaxation induced by\nsubstance P or acetylcholine. EPT did not affect ambulatory blood pressure, heart\nrate or HRV.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral combined medium-term EPT reduces adrenergic reactivity in\nsubcutaneous arteries from treated hypertensive postmenopausal women. EPT might\nact postjunctionally at the adrenergic vascular receptor level. In the present\nstudy, EPT neither reduces sympathetic activity nor increases vagal tone, and\nthus does not support an effect on the central hemodynamic system.\n\nPMID: 19958076  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Data from the Women's Health \nInitiative observational study (1993-2004) were included in some analyses for\nadditional precision. Results are presented here for incident coronary heart\ndisease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, breast cancer, colorectal cancer,\nendometrial cancer, or hip fracture; death from other causes; a summary global\nindex; total cancer; and total mortality. Hazard ratios for breast cancer and\ntotal cancer were comparatively higher (P < 0.05) among women who initiated\nhormone therapy soon after menopause, for both regimens. Among these women, use\nof conjugated equine estrogens appeared to produce elevations in venous\nthromboembolism and stroke and a reduction in hip fracture. Estrogen plus\nprogestin results among women who initiated use soon after menopause were similar\nfor venous thromboembolism, stroke, and hip fracture but also included evidence\nof longer-term elevations in breast cancer, total cancer, and the global index.\nThese analyses provide little support for the hypothesis of favorable effects\namong women who initiate postmenopausal estrogen use soon after menopause, either\nfor coronary heart disease or for health benefits versus risk indices considered.\n\nPMCID: PMC2733042\nPMID: 19468079  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Hot flushes were assessed at baseline using self-administered\nquestionnaires; women reporting bothersome hot flushes "some" to "all" of the\ntime were considered to have clinically significant flushing. Cox regression\nmodels were used to examine the effect of EPT on risk of CHD events among women\nwith and without significant flushing at baseline.\nRESULTS: The mean age of participants was 66.7 +/- 6.8 years, and 89% (n = 2,448)\nwere white. Sixteen percent (n = 434) of participants reported clinically\nsignificant hot flushes at baseline. Among women with baseline flushing, EPT\nincreased risk of CHD events nine-fold in the first year compared with placebo\n(hazard ratio = 9.01; 95% CI, 1.15-70.35); among women without baseline flushing,\ntreatment did not significantly affect CHD event risk in the first year (hazard\nratio = 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86-2.03; P = 0.07 for interaction of hot flushes with\ntreatment). The trend toward differential effects of EPT on risk for CHD among\nwomen with and without baseline flushing did not persist after the first year of \ntreatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among older postmenopausal women with CHD, EPT may increase risk of \nCHD events substantially in the first year of treatment among women with\nclinically significant hot flushes but not among those without hot flushes.\n\nPMCID: PMC2856618\nPMID: 19325499  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, or\nplacebo was given to 10 739 hysterectomized women, and the same estrogen plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, was given to 16 608 women with an intact\nuterus.\nRESULTS: In multivariate-adjusted analyses of 359 cases and 820 controls in the\ncombined trials, baseline levels of 12 of the 23 biomarkers studied were\nassociated with CHD events: interleukin 6, matrix metalloproteinase 9,\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total \ncholesterol, triglycerides, D-dimer, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor,\nleukocyte count, homocysteine, and fasting insulin. Biomarkers tended to be more \nstrongly associated with CHD in the initial 2 years after randomization. The\ngenetic polymorphism glycoprotein IIIa leu33pro was significantly associated with\nCHD. Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol interacted significantly with\nHT so that women with higher levels were at higher risk for CHD when given HT (P \n= .03 for interaction). The levels of several biomarkers were changed by HT, but \nthese changes did not seem to be associated with future CHD events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Several thrombotic, inflammatory, and lipid biomarkers were\nassociated with CHD events in postmenopausal women, but only low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol modified the effect of HT. Further research is needed to \nidentify the mechanisms by which HT increases the risk of CHD.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMCID: PMC2726792\nPMID: 19001202  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Here, we compare the effect of combined HT and tibolone on\nmetabolic risk markers for the development of cardiovascular disease.\nMETHODS: Postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to 1.25 or 2.5 mg/day of\ntibolone or oral continuous combined conjugated equine estrogen plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA). Cardiovascular risk factors were\ndetermined at baseline and after 12 months of treatment.\nRESULTS: Body mass index and blood pressure were unaffected by the HT. HOMA-IR\ndecreased in the CEE/MPA group (3.69 vs. 3.38; p = 0.02). Treatment with tibolone\nincreased tissue-type plasminogen activator activity (0.87 IU/ml vs. 1.21 IU/ml; \np = 0.005) and C-reactive protein (0.83 mg/l vs. 1.88 mg/l; p < 0.001), and\ndecreased plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (6.9 IU/ml vs. 2.0 IU/ml; p < \n0.001) and triglycerides (0.99 vs. 0.87 mmol/l; p = 0.004).

Women with hypertension also appeared to\nbe at greater risk for probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n(hazard ratio=1.35, 95% confidence interval=1.07-1.70, P=.01), although when\npotential cofounders were accounted for, this association was no longer\nsignificant (P=.06).\nCONCLUSION: Hypertension and high blood pressure at baseline were not\nindependently associated with MCI or probable dementia over time in older,\ncognitively intact, postmenopausal women enrolled in WHIMS after other potential \nconfounders were taken into account. These analyses should not be viewed as\ndiscouraging appropriate medical treatment for hypertension.\n\nPMID: 18637980  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Postmenopausal hormone therapy raised\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol and particle concentration and reduced\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; all P<0.001 versus placebo). In\ncontrast, neither unopposed estrogen nor estrogen with progestin lowered\nlow-density lipoprotein particle concentration (LDL-P).\nCONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal hormone therapy-induced reductions in LDL-C were not \nparalleled by favorable effects on LDL-P. This finding may account for the\nabsence of coronary protection conferred by estrogen in the randomized hormone\ntrials.\n\nPMCID: PMC2701372\nPMID: 18599797  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Soluble cell adhesion molecules have been associated with \ncardiovascular risk factors and events. HT reduces circulating levels of soluble \ncell adhesion molecules in healthy postmenopausal women, but its effects in\npostmenopausal women with coronary artery disease are less clear. We assessed the\neffect of HT on soluble cell adhesion molecules in the Estrogen Replacement and\nAtherosclerosis trial.\nDESIGN: The Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial was a double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled study that randomized 309 postmenopausal women (mean age, 65.8\ny) to daily unopposed estrogen (conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg), estrogen plus 2.5\nmg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, or placebo, with a mean follow-up period of\n3.2 years. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion\nmolecule-1, and E-selectin were measured in serum obtained from participants at\nbaseline and after 12 months of follow-up.\nRESULTS: Of the 265 women with complete data, 87 women were assigned to unopposed\nestrogen, 88 women to estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 90 women to \nplacebo. Compared with placebo, 12 months of HT (n = 175) was associated with\nreductions in soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (25.6 +/- 4.7 vs 10.6 +/-\n6.4 ng/mL, P = 0.06), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (80.2+/- 10.6 vs \n28.8 +/- 14.7 ng/mL, P = 0.005), and E-selectin (8.8 +/- 0.9 vs -1.1 +/- 1.2\nng/mL, P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Twelve months of HT in postmenopausal women with established\ncoronary artery disease was associated with reductions in serum markers of\nendothelial cell activation/injury such as soluble intercellular adhesion\nmolecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin.\n\nPMID: 18521047  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The Heart and Estrogen\nReplacement Study evaluated the effects of hormone treatment on cardiovascular\nevents among 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease. Kidney\ndysfunction was categorized by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using \nthe Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Multivariate proportional\nhazards models were used to adjust for cardiovascular risk factors, congestive\nheart failure, and myocardial infarction. At baseline, 37% (n=1027) had an eGFR\nof >60 mL/min, 54% (n=1503) had an eGFR of 40 to 60 mL/min, and 8% (n=230) had an\neGFR of <40 mL/min. During the 6.8-year follow-up period, there were 136\nadjudicated sudden cardiac deaths. The rate of sudden cardiac death was higher in\nthose with lower kidney function (0.5% per year among those with an eGFR >60;\n0.6% per year with an eGFR between 40 and 60; and 1.7% per year with an eGFR <40 \nmL/min; P for trend <0.001). After multivariate analysis with baseline risk\nfactors, eGFR at 40 to 60 mL/min was not a significant predictor, but eGFR at <40\nmL/min remained strongly associated with sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio: 3.2;\n95% CI: 1.9 to 5.3); adjustment for incident congestive heart failure and\nmyocardial infarction during follow-up diminished this association (hazard ratio:\n2.3; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.9), suggesting that congestive heart failure and myocardial\ninfarction mediated only part of the association between kidney dysfunction and\nsudden cardiac death. Advanced kidney dysfunction is an independent predictor of \nsudden cardiac death among women with coronary heart disease.\n\nPMID: 18391103  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The objective of this study\nwas to evaluate the effects of hormone therapy, tibolone and raloxifene on the\nserum adipocytokines resistin and adiponectin as well as on circulating markers\nof receptor-mediated apoptosis. Design Randomized, open-label, intervention study\nin the Menopause Clinic of a University Hospital.\nMETHODS: One hundred healthy postmenopausal women were randomized to the\nfollowing groups: conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg (CEE) (n = 16); 17\nbeta-estradiol 1 mg plus norethisterone acetate 0.5 mg (E(2)/NETA) (n = 15);\ntibolone 2.5 mg (n = 18); raloxifene HCl 60 mg (n = 20); and no treatment (n =\n19). Eighty-eight women completed the 3-month study period. Main outcome measures\nwere levels of serum adiponectin, resistin, soluble Fas and Fas ligand.\nRESULTS: Levels of serum adiponectin decreased significantly in the tibolone\ngroup (baseline: 10 556.7 +/- 4213.5 ng/ml; 3 months: 7856.3 +/- 3450.7 ng/ml; p \n= 0.0001) and increased in the CEE group (baseline: 9268.1 +/- 5158 ng/ml; 3\nmonths: 11 302.6 +/- 4980.9 ng/ml; p = 0.01).

The\npostintervention phase commenced July 8, 2002, and included 15 730 women.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Semi-annual monitoring and outcomes ascertainment\ncontinued per trial protocol. The primary end points were coronary heart disease \nand invasive breast cancer. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and\nbenefits included the 2 primary end points plus stroke, pulmonary embolism,\nendometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other\ncauses.\nRESULTS: The risk of cardiovascular events after the intervention was comparable \nby initial randomized assignments, 1.97% (annualized rate) in the CEE plus MPA\n(343 events) and 1.91% in the placebo group (323 events). A greater risk of\nmalignancies occurred in the CEE plus MPA than in the placebo group (1.56% [n =\n281] vs 1.26% [n = 218]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI],\n1.04-1.48). More breast cancers were diagnosed in women who had been randomly\nassigned to receive CEE plus MPA vs placebo (0.42% [n = 79] vs 0.33% [n = 60];\nHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.91-1.78) with a modest trend toward a lower HR during the\nfollow-up after the intervention. All-cause mortality was somewhat higher in the \nCEE plus MPA than in the placebo group (1.20% [n = 233] vs 1.06% [n = 196]; HR,\n1.15; 95% CI, 0.95-1.39). The global index of risks and benefits was unchanged\nfrom randomization through March 31, 2005 (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21),\nindicating that the risks of CEE plus MPA exceed the benefits for chronic disease\nprevention.\nCONCLUSIONS: The increased cardiovascular risks in the women assigned to CEE plus\nMPA during the intervention period were not observed after the intervention. A\ngreater risk of fatal and nonfatal malignancies occurred after the intervention\nin the CEE plus MPA group and the global risk index was 12% higher in women\nrandomly assigned to receive CEE plus MPA compared with placebo.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMID: 18319414  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2008 Feb 15.\n\nEstrogen, medroxyprogesterone acetate, endothelial function, and biomarkers of\ncardiovascular risk in young women.\n\nMeendering JR(1), Torgrimson BN, Miller NP, Kaplan PF, Minson CT.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.\n\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is widely known for its use in combination\nhormone therapy for postmenopausal women. However, MPA is also commonly used in\nyoung women for contraception and treatment of a number of gynecological\nconditions. Despite its widespread use, the cardiovascular effects of MPA in\nyoung women are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine\nthe acute effects of MPA when used in combination with estradiol on markers of\ncardiovascular risk in young women. We suppressed endogenous estrogens and\nprogesterone in 10 premenopausal women using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone\nantagonist (GnRHa) for 10 days. On day 4 of GnRHa subjects received 0.1 mg of\nestradiol (GnRHa+E(2)), and on day 7 5 mg of MPA was added (GnRHa+E(2)+MPA).\nEndothelium-dependent vasodilation and endothelium-independent vasodilation of\nthe brachial artery, lipids, homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,\nand endothelin-1 were assessed during treatment with GnRHa, GnRHa+E(2), and\nGnRHa+E(2)+MPA. Four additional subjects were tested to validate the efficacy of \nthe GnRHa model and confirm the findings. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was \ngreater during GnRHa+E(2) than during GnRHa or GnRHa+E(2)+MPA (P = 0.006).\nEndothelin-1 was lower during GnRHa+E(2) than GnRHa alone (P = 0.039).\nEndothelin-1 increased with the addition of MPA and was not significantly\ndifferent from GnRHa alone. There were no differences in the other markers of\ncardiovascular risk between hormone treatment days. These data suggest that acute\nMPA administration negates the beneficial effects of estradiol on\nendothelium-dependent vasodilation in young women. In addition, these data\nsuggest that estradiol decreases endothelin-1 concentrations and the addition of \nMPA may counteract the effect of estradiol on endothelin-1.\n\nPMCID: PMC3012002\nPMID: 18281378  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The aim of the\nstudy was to assess the effect of conjugated equine estrogens alone or in\ncombination with medroxyprogesterone acetate, low-dose 17beta-estradiol combined \nwith norethisterone acetate and tibolone on inhibitors of coagulation.\nMETHODS: Two hundred and sixteen postmenopausal women received orally either\nconjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg (CEE, n=24) or tibolone 2.5 mg (n=24) or\nCEE+medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg (CEE/MPA, n=34) or 17beta-estradiol 1\nmg+norethisterone acetate 0.5 mg (E2/NETA, n=66) or no therapy (control, n=68)\nfor 12 months. Plasma antithrombin, protein C and total protein S were measured\nat baseline and at 12 months.\nRESULTS: CEE, CEE/MPA and E2/NETA treatment were associated with a significant\ndecrease in antithrombin levels (CEE: baseline 235.6+/-47.6 mg/l, follow-up\n221.3+/-48.3 mg/l, p=0.0001; CEE/MPA: baseline 251.1+/-38.6 mg/l, follow-up\n225.0+/-42.6 mg/l, p=0.009; E2/NETA: baseline 257.1+/-59.4 mg/l, follow-up\n227.1+/-50.4 mg/l, p=0.007; tibolone: baseline 252.6+/-62.4 mg/l, follow-up\n261.9+/-59.1 mg/l, p=0.39).

Climacteric. 2007 Jun;10(3):225-37.\n\nDistinct lipid/lipoprotein profiles and hormonal responsiveness in nine ethnic\ngroups of postmenopausal Asian women: the Pan-Asia Menopause (PAM) study.\n\nTaechakraichana N(1), Holinka CF, Haines CJ, Subramaniam R, Tian XW, Ausmanas MK.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Chulalongkorn Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nBACKGROUND: Lipid/lipoprotein profiles, among other factors, are associated with \nrisk of cardiovascular disease. Because cardiovascular disease varies in Asian\ncountries, we hypothesized that lipid profiles differ in ethnic groups of\npostmenopausal Asian women. To add to the limited body of information currently\navailable, we also investigated the effects of estrogen/progestin therapy on\nlipid/lipoprotein profiles in postmenopausal Asian women.\nMETHODS: The Pan-Asia Menopause (PAM) study was a prospective, randomized,\ndouble-blind clinical trial evaluating 1028 postmenopausal women at 22\ninvestigational centers in 11 Asian countries/territories. Subjects were randomly\nassigned to one of three doses of continuous combined conjugated estrogens\n(CE)/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): CE/MPA (in mg/day) = 0.625/2.5, 0.45/1.5 \nor 0.3/1.5. The treatment period, following baseline evaluations, consisted of\nsix continuous 28-day cycles. Analysis of lipid profiles was a secondary\nobjective of the PAM study. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low\ndensity cholesterol (VLDC-C), triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) were analyzed at a\ncentral laboratory by state-of-the-art methods.\nRESULTS: Mean concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and\ntriglycerides differed significantly among the nine ethnic groups of\npostmenopausal women. This difference was independent of body mass index and age,\ntwo factors that also influenced lipid/lipoprotein profiles. Mean HDL-C\nconcentrations also differed, but this difference was influenced by body mass\nindex in a weak interaction. All three doses of CE/MPA significantly lowered\ntotal cholesterol. Treatment with the high and middle doses significantly lowered\nLDL-C, and increased HDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides. The high dose produced a\nsignificant decrease in lipoprotein(a).\nCONCLUSIONS: The different lipid/lipoprotein profiles in the nine ethnic groups\nof postmenopausal Asian women evaluated here suggest a relationship to\ndifferences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease reported for different\nregions in Asia. However, the reported prevalence data on cardiovascular disease \nmorbidity and mortality in the regions corresponding to the nine ethnic groups\nare insufficient to allow qualitative comparisons with the lipid profiles shown\nin our study. The lipid/lipoprotein changes in response to estrogen/progestin\ntherapy observed here are consistent with those reported for Western women.\n\nPMID: 17487649  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Anthropometric indices (body weight,\nheight, and hip and waist circumferences) were measured, and BMI and waist-to-hip\nratio (WHR) were calculated, before and after treatment. Also, the thickness of\nsubcutaneous abdominal fat was measured by ultrasound. Depending on waist\ncircumference (WC), the subjects were divided into two risk groups:\nincreased-risk group with WC <88 cm (n = 32) and high-risk group with WC > or =88\ncm (n = 27). Also, the effects of HRT were evaluated separately in subjects with \nmedian subcutaneous fat of <33 mm (n = 29) and those with median subcutaneous fat\nof > or =33 mm (n = 30).\nRESULTS: Overall, all three types of HRT caused a significant decrease in both WC\nand subcutaneous fat (p < 0.001), and also in WHR (p < 0.05). There was no\nsignificant difference in baseline (p > 0.05) and final values (p > 0.05) between\nHRT groups. In each group, all types of HRT significantly decreased WC and\nsubcutaneous fat (transdermal group: p < 0.001 and p < 0.05; transdermal/oral\ngroup: p < 0.001 and p < 0.01; oral group: p < 0.001 and p < 0.001,\nrespectively), while body weight, BMI and WHR changed only insignificantly (p >\n0.05). In the increased-risk group, body weight increased significantly (p <\n0.05) while WC and subcutaneous fat decreased significantly (p < 0.001 and p <\n0.001). As for the high-risk group, there was a significant decrease in WC and\nsubcutaneous fat (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) while the remaining parameters did not\nchange significantly. However, BMI showed a tendency to increase in the\nincreased-risk group, while there was a decrease in all measurements in the\nhigh-risk group. Regardless of the drugs used and baseline subcutaneous fat, WC\nand subcutaneous fat decreased significantly at the end of the treatment\n(subcutaneous fat <33 mm: p < 0.001 and p < 0.01; subcutaneous fat > or =33 mm: p\n< 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: The three different types of HRT have comparable effects on central \nfat tissue in women at increased risk of anthropometry-related CVD. Indeed, the\nthree combinations of HRT reduced fat tissue in the central part of the body.\nHowever, the overall effect of HRT was more marked in women with WC > or =88 cm\nand subcutaneous fat > or =33 cm. Whether HRT increases body weight depends on\nthe body composition indices of individuals before treatment.\n\nPMID: 17454160  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Women aged 50 to 79 years were recruited to the\nstudy from 40 US clinical centers between September 1993 and October 1998.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical test for trend of the effect of hormone\ntherapy on coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke across categories of age and\nyears since menopause in the combined trials.\nRESULTS: In the combined trials, there were 396 cases of CHD and 327 cases of\nstroke in the hormone therapy group vs 370 [corrected] cases of CHD and 239 cases\nof stroke in the placebo group. For women with less than 10 years since menopause\nbegan, the hazard ratio (HR) for CHD was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI],\n0.50-1.16); 10 to 19 years, 1.10 (95% CI, 0.84-1.45); and 20 or more years, 1.28 \n(95% CI, 1.03-1.58) (P for trend = .02). The estimated absolute excess risk for\nCHD for women within 10 years of menopause was -6 per 10,000 person-years; for\nwomen 10 to 19 years since menopause began, 4 per 10,000 person-years; and for\nwomen 20 or more years from menopause onset, 17 per 10,000 person-years. For the \nage group of 50 to 59 years, the HR for CHD was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.65-1.33) and the \nabsolute excess risk was -2 per 10,000 person-years; 60 to 69 years, 0.98 (95%\nCI, 0.79-1.21) and -1 per 10,000 person-years; and 70 to 79 years, 1.26 (95% CI, \n1.00-1.59) and 19 per 10,000 person-years (P for trend = .16). Hormone therapy\nincreased the risk of stroke (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12-1.56). Risk did not vary\nsignificantly by age or time since menopause. There was a nonsignificant tendency\nfor the effects of hormone therapy on total mortality to be more favorable in\nyounger than older women (HR of 0.70 for 50-59 years; 1.05 for 60-69 years, and\n1.14 for 70-79 years; P for trend = .06).\nCONCLUSIONS: Women who initiated hormone therapy closer to menopause tended to\nhave reduced CHD risk compared with the increase in CHD risk among women more\ndistant from menopause, but this trend test did not meet our criterion for\nstatistical significance. A similar nonsignificant trend was observed for total\nmortality but the risk of stroke was elevated regardless of years since\nmenopause. These data should be considered in regard to the short-term treatment \nof menopausal symptoms.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.\n\nPMID: 17405972  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Estrogen has been shown\nto enhance endothelial-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in healthy and \nyounger women. The effect of estrogen on older and less healthy postmenopausal\nwomen with atherosclerosis is unclear.\nMETHODS: The Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial randomized 309\npostmenopausal women with established coronary atherosclerosis (mean, 65.8 years)\nto unopposed estrogen (conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg), estrogen plus 2.5 mg\nmedroxyprogesterone actate (MPA), or placebo. After mean of 3.2 years of\nfollow-up, brachial FMD was measured using 2-dimensional ultrasound in women\navailable for follow-up at 4 of the 5 clinic sites (n = 198).\nRESULTS: The %FMD of the brachial artery was not statistically different in the\nplacebo arm compared with either unopposed estrogen or estrogen + MPA arm in both\nthe adjusted and the unadjusted models. Subsequent analysis combining the\nestrogen arm with the estrogen + MPA arm and comparing with the placebo arm was\nalso not significant in both the adjusted and the unadjusted models. Similar\nresults were obtained when analyses were limited to women who took >80% of the\nstudy medication over the course of the trial (n = 133).\nCONCLUSION: An average of 3.2 years of treatment with unopposed estrogen or\nestrogen plus progestins did not result in significant improvements in\nendothelial vasodilation compared with placebo. This apparent absence of an\neffect on brachial artery endothelial function in older postmenopausal women with\nestablished coronary heart disease may help explain the lack of benefit of\nestrogen for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.\n\nPMID: 17307425  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

For the last six months, all received the 1 +\n2.5 dosage. The 2 + 2.5 dosage was discontinued at the end of year 7. A total of \n198 women continued after year 7.\nRESULTS: Annualized percentage rates for cardiovascular events [corrected] and\nendometrial cancers [corrected] were below national rates for Finland and those\nreported for the Women's Health Initiative. There were no serious events with the\n1 + 2.5 dosage or after ccHRT discontinuation. Climacteric symptoms remained\nsignificantly below baseline values after dosage reduction; some symptoms\nrecurred after discontinuation of ccHRT. HRQOL ratings improved with ccHRT,\nirrespective of dosage, including depressed mood, anxiety, health perception and \nsexual interest. Scores on a scale assessing daily functioning and enjoyment\n(Q-LES-Q) improved from year 7 to year 9. They deteriorated during follow-up in\nwomen not continuing ccHRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower dosages of HRT were as effective as higher doses in improving \nclimacteric symptoms and HRQOL ratings and had fewer safety concerns. Following\ndiscontinuation of ccHRT, patient satisfaction was variable, with 15% electing to\ncontinue or restart HRT and 7% resuming at follow-up. This supports the need for \nan individualized approach to therapy recommendations.\n\nPMID: 16953985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The\neffects of HT on SVG vessels are unknown. To determine whether postmenopausal\nhormone therapy started after coronary bypass surgery (CABG) decreases saphenous \nvein graft (SVG) disease, we conducted a multicenter randomized\nplacebo-controlled angiographic study of estradiol+/-medroxyprogesterone started \nwithin 6 months of CABG in 83 postmenopausal women. Angiographic and\nintravascular ultrasound (IVUS) assessment at 6 and 42 months was planned to\nassess SVG disease progression. The study was stopped early following publication\nof the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen/Progestin study. Eighty-three subjects \nunderwent a 6-month angiogram with 63 undergoing IVUS. Forty-five subjects\ncompleted the 42-month angiogram (20 underwent 42-month IVUS). In analysis of\npaired 6- and 42-month angiogram and IVUS studies, HT slowed angiographic\nprogression of SVG disease assessed by mean percent stenosis (p<0.001), minimal\nlumen diameter (p=0.029), and total plaque volume (p=0.006). In contrast, HT\naccelerated disease progression in non-bypassed native coronary arteries (minimum\nlumen diameter, p=0.01). SVG disease and closure occurred in 38% subjects within \n1-year post-CABG. The groups had similar frequency of cardiovascular events\nexpect for angioplasty that occurred in eight HT compared to one placebo subject \n(p<0.05). In HT subjects angioplasty was indicated for native coronary arterial\nstenoses while in the placebo subject angioplasty was indicated for SVG stenosis.\nThis study suggests that hormone treatment may slow SVG disease progression while\naccelerating atherosclerosis in non-bypassed native coronary arteries.\n\nPMID: 16442114  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The evidence mainly came from the effects of\ncombined conjugated equine oestrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA) \ntherapy. Other HT regimes had not been studied widely. Tibolone, a selective\ntissue oestrogenic activity regulator, has several effects on cardiovascular risk\nfactors, one of which is HDL lowering. Because the overall effect of tibolone on \ncardiovascular risk was unknown, the OPAL study was designed.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The OPAL study was a three-arm, randomized,\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind study to determine the effect of tibolone (2.5\nmg daily) and of CEE/MPA (0.625/2.5 mg daily) over 3 years on progression of\ncarotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in 866 healthy post-menopausal women. The\nwomen were recruited from six US and five European centres. The primary outcome\nwas change in mean common CIMT. Annual common CIMT progression rates in the\ntibolone and CEE/MPA groups were higher than in the placebo group: 0.0077 mm [95%\nconfidence interval (CI) 0.0051-0.0103] in the tibolone group, 0.0074 mm\n(0.0048-0.0099) in the CEE/MPA group, and 0.0035 mm (0.009-0.0061) in the placebo\ngroup. The differences with placebo (0.0042 mm/year for tibolone and 0.0039\nmm/year for CEE/MPA) were statistically significant. HDL cholesterol increased in\nCEE/MPA group and was lowered in the tibolone group.\nCONCLUSION: Both tibolone and CEE/MPA showed increased progression of common\nCIMT. Translation of the increased common CIMT progression of the CEE/MPA group\ninto cardiovascular disease risk could not fully explain the observed increased\ncardiovascular risk as observed in the Women's Health Initiative study. This\nsuggests that the net effect of tibolone and CEE/MPA on cardiovascular events may\ndepend on the combined effects on the arterial wall, clotting factors, and\npossibly inflammation.\n\nPMID: 16415304  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Hormonal\nreplacement therapy (HRT) affects plasma HDL cholesterol levels, with estrogen\nincreasing HDL cholesterol levels and progestins blunting this effect. This study\nwas designed to assess the mechanism responsible for these effects.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: HDL apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) kinetics were studied in 8\nhealthy postmenopausal women participating in a double-blind, randomized,\ncrossover study comprising 3 phases: placebo, conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)\n(0.625 mg/d), and CEE plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (2.5 mg/d). Compared\nwith placebo, treatment with CEE resulted in an increase in apoA-I pool size\n(+20%, P<0.01) because of a significant increase in apoA-I production rate (+47%,\nP<0.05) and no significant changes in apoA-I fractional catabolic rate. Compared \nwith the CEE alone phase, treatment with the CEE plus MPA resulted in an 8%\n(P<0.02) reduction in apoA-I pool size and a significant reduction in apoA-I\nproduction rate (-13%, P<0.04), without changes in apoA-I fractional catabolic\nrate.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal estrogen replacement increases apoA-I levels and\nproduction rate. When progestin is added to estrogen, it opposes these effects by\nreducing the production of apoA-I.\n\nPMCID: PMC3229925\nPMID: 16339502  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

This study was designed to investigate\nthe effect of transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on carotid IMT and\nvascular inflammatory markers in postmenopausal women and to explore the\ninterrelationship between the change in carotid IMT and the changes in vascular\ninflammatory markers. Thirty-five postmenopausal women (mean age 57.0+/-7.7\nyears) received transdermal HRT (continuous 17beta-estradiol patch [36\nmicrog/day] plus cyclic oral medroxyprogesterone acetate [2.5 mg/day, for 12\ndays/ month]) for 12 months, and 32 controls (mean age 58.0+/-7.5 years) did not.\nCarotid IMT, assessed by ultrasound, and circulating vascular inflammatory\nmarkers, i.e., C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule\n(ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, E-selectin, monocyte\nchemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 were\nmeasured before and after 12 months of treatment. In the HRT group, carotid IMT\ndecreased significantly (p<0.01), from 0.71+/-0.13 mm to 0.65+/-0.12 mm, and the \nICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and MCP-1 levels decreased significantly (p<0.01 for \nall), but the CRP and MMP-9 levels remained unchanged. Carotid IMT and vascular\ninflammatory markers were unchanged in the control group. In the HRT group, the\nchange in carotid IMT was significantly correlated with the change in serum\nE-selectin (r=0.38, p<0.05), but not with the changes in other vascular\ninflammatory markers. These results suggest that transdermal HRT reduced carotid \nartery wall thickness, and that the reduction may have been induced by an\nantiatherosclerotic effect combined with the direct effect of estrogen and\ndecreased levels of estrogen-induced E-selectin.\n\nPMID: 16335886  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

No such associations were observed in the\nestrogen women atherosclerosis (EWA) study of 118 women with established coronary\nartery disease who were given transdermal HRT.\nOBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects \nof oral and transdermal HRT on levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which was\nassayed with a highly sensitive method. We also evaluated the effects on other\ninflammatory markers and the influence of possible confounding factors.\nRESULTS: Oral HRT was associated with a significant increase in CRP after 3\nmonths as compared with placebo (median 79% [95% confidence interval 36-119%]\nversus -4% [-13 to 10%], p = 0.001). These changes sustained after 12 months.\nAmong those allocated HRT, the median increase in CRP was higher in women who\nsubsequently developed recurrent thrombosis (median 328%, n = 5, versus 54%, n = \n60). TNF-alpha levels decreased significantly by mean -10% [-15 to -5%] versus 3%\n[-4 to 10%], p=0.004. Soluble VCAM-1 decreased in the HRT group compared to the\nplacebo group (mean -13% [-18 to -8%] versus 1%, [-3 to 5%], p < 0.001). There\nwere no significant changes in levels of IL-6, TGF-beta or P-selectin. On\ntransdermal HRT no significant changes in CRP were observed after 3 and 12 months\nof treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings substantiate that oral HRT containing estradiol is\nassociated with a marked and rapid increase in CRP, whereas transdermal treatment\nis not. However, this increase on oral treatment was associated with no increases\nof other inflammatory markers.\n\nPMID: 16186073  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We used the\nmicrochannel method to investigate whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with\nconjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) affects\nblood flow through the microchannels in hypertensive postmenopausal women being\ntreated with antihypertensive drugs and in normotensive postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: Sixty-two consecutive postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to a\nhypertensive HRT group (n=16), hypertensive control group (n=15), normotensive\nHRT group (n=16) and normotensive control group (n=15). Each HRT group received\nCEE 0.625 mg plus MPA 2.5 mg daily orally for 12 months. Both hypertensive groups\nwere being treated with antihypertensive drugs before the study. Microvascular\nblood flow was assessed on the basis of blood passage time, the time required for\n100 microl of whole blood to pass through a cylinder, was determined before and\n12 months after the start of HRT by the microchannel method (micro channel array \nflow analyzer).\nRESULTS: CEE plus MPA therapy did not change blood passage time in any of the\ngroups. Microscopic observation showed that the whole blood passed smoothly\nthrough the microchannels in every group.\nCONCLUSIONS: CEE plus MPA therapy may not impair blood flow through the\nmicrochannels in hypertensive postmenopausal women receiving antihypertensive\ndrugs or in normotensive postmenopausal women. However, administration of CEE\nplus MPA to postmenopausal women with hypertension warrants caution against the\noccurrence of thromboembolic events.\n\nPMID: 16040211  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The primary outcome for these analyses was\nnonfatal myocardial infarction or CHD death during a mean follow up of 4.1 years.\nRESULTS: The baseline serum UA for the cohort was 5.4 mg/dl and, compared with\nplacebo, E+P on average lowered serum UA levels slightly (0.2 mg/dl) at one year \nof follow up (p<0.0001). Baseline serum UA levels were associated in simple\nproportional hazards models with CHD events; each standard deviation increase\n(1.3 mg/dl) was associated with a 22% increased risk of primary CHD events\n(p=.0001). This association, however, was no longer statistically significant\nafter multivariable adjustment (p=0.36). There was no association between\non-study change in serum UA level and any CHD outcome.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with E+P lowered serum UA levels slightly, but neither\nbaseline UA nor change in UA affected CHD risk.\n\nPMID: 16039873  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Here we measured the effects of differing\nestrogen/progestogen combinations on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF\nbinding protein (IGFBP) system which has been implicated in the\npathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease, higher IGFBP-1\nlevels having been linked with a reduced cardiovascular risk.\nDESIGN: Oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, or in combination with the \nincreasingly androgenic progestogens medroxyprogesterone acetate, desogestrel or \nnorethisterone, were given in a randomized triple crossover fashion to 35 healthy\npostmenopausal women. Serum concentrations of IGFs and the principal circulating \nIGFBPs were measured.\nRESULTS: Circulating IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio were\nsignificantly reduced by CEE. These effects were reversed by progestogens\naccording to their androgenicity. Plasma IGFBP-1 concentration increased from\nbaseline to CEE alone. This rise was opposed by progestogens of increasing\nandrogenicity. IGFBP-2 levels fell and IGFBP-4 increased with CEE, with no\nfurther change with addition of progestogens. CEE increased the proportional\ncontribution of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-4 to total IGFBP binding and decreased the\nIGFBP-3 contribution. This was reversed by progestogens.\nCONCLUSION: There are marked changes in molar ratios of the IGFBPs in relation to\nestrogen/progestogens in HRT. The effect of progestogens on IGF bioavailability\ncould be an important determinant of the longer-term risks of specific HRT\npreparations by opposing the potentially beneficial effects of CEE alone on\ncardiovascular risk.\n\nPMID: 16019358  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However,\nsleep and gender may influence therapeutic responses. We investigated the effects\nof a 2-week medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy on sleep and nocturnal\nbreathing in postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: A single-blind placebo-controlled trial was performed in 15\npostmenopausal women with moderate to severe COPD. A 12-week trial included\n2-week treatment periods with placebo and MPA (60 mg/d/14 days). All patients\nunderwent a polysomnography with monitoring of SaO2 and transcutaneous PCO2\n(tcCO2) at baseline, with placebo, with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 60\nmg/d/14 days), and three and six weeks after cessation of MPA.\nRESULTS: Thirteen patients completed the trial. At baseline, the average +/- SD\nof SaO2 mean was 90.6 +/- 3.2 % and the median of SaO2 nadir 84.8 %\n(interquartile range, IQR 6.1). MPA improved them by 1.7 +/- 1.6 %-units (95 %\nconfidence interval (CI) 0.56, 2.8) and by 3.9 %-units (IQR 4.9; 95% CI 0.24,\n10.2), respectively. The average of tcCO2 median was 6.0 +/- 0.9 kPa and\ndecreased with MPA by 0.9 +/- 0.5 kPa (95% CI -1.3, -0.54). MPA improved SaO2\nnadir and tcCO2 median also during REM sleep. Three weeks after cessation of MPA,\nthe SaO2 mean remained 1.4 +/- 1.8 %-units higher than at baseline, the\ndifference being not significant (95% CI -0.03, 2.8). SaO2 nadir was 2.7 %-units \n(IQR 4.9; 95% CI 0.06, 18.7) higher than at baseline. Increases in SaO2 mean and \nSaO2 nadir during sleep with MPA were inversely associated with baseline SaO2\nmean (r = -0.70, p = 0.032) and baseline SaO2 nadir (r = -0.77, p = 0.008),\nrespectively. Treatment response in SaO2 mean, SaO2 nadir and tcCO2 levels did\nnot associate with pack-years smoked, age, BMI, spirometric results or sleep\nvariables.\nCONCLUSION: MPA-induced respiratory improvement in postmenopausal women seems to \nbe consistent and prolonged. The improvement was greater in patients with lower\nbaseline SaO2 values. Long-term studies in females are warranted.\n\nPMCID: PMC1079947\nPMID: 15807890  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) improves endothelial\nfunction in post-menopausal women (PMW) without established atherosclerosis. New \nalternative treatments, among which tibolone (T) and DHEAS have been suggested to\nreduce postmenopausal cardiovascular risk. Although, in vitro animal studies have\nsuggested that T and DHEAS improve endothelial function, their effect in humans\nhas never been tested. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of\nHRT (continuous combined 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d\nmedoxyprogesterone) DHEAS and T on endothelium-dependent flow-mediated\nvasodilatation (FMD), plasma nitrite, nitrate and endothelin-1 levels in 16 PMW\nwith increased cardiovascular risk in a double-blinded, double-crossover study.\nWomen were randomized and treated for 4 weeks with HRT, T or DHEAS. Brachial\nartery diameter, FMD, endothelin-1 and plasma nitrite and nitrate levels were\nmeasured at baseline and after each treatment phase. Brachial artery diameters\nremained unchanged after each treatment phase. HRT significantly improved FMD\ncompared to both baseline and to T and DHEAS therapies while no effect of T or\nDHEAS on FMD was noted. In conclusion, HRT, but neither T nor DHEAS, improves\nendothelial function and reduces plasma levels of endothelin-1 in PMW at risk of \nCAD.\n\nPMID: 15780531  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Plasma\nhomocysteine levels were evaluated at the end of each treatment period.\nRESULTS: Only HRT, alone and in combination with simvastatin, significantly\nreduced homocysteine levels compared with placebo (11.82 +/- 0.74 and 12.22 +/-\n0.71 vs 13.58 +/- 0.83 micromol/L, respectively, p < 0.05). Simvastatin had no\neffect (13.02 +/- 0.94 micromol/L), and the combination therapy was not better\nthat monotherapy with HRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral HRT reduces homocysteine plasma levels, whereas simvastatin has\nno effect. If confirmed by randomized, prospective studies with clinical end\npoints, HRT may be considered for women with mild hypercholesterolemia and high\nhomocysteine levels.\n\nPMID: 15775733  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Unopposed estradiol was given for 3 months, and\nMPA was added in cycles of 14 days every 3 months. Clinical investigations were\nundertaken at baseline and after 3 months and 12 months. Insulin sensitivity\nindex (HOMA-IR) and insulin secretion (HOMA-BCF) were calculated using the\nhomeostasis model assessment.\nRESULTS: Compared with the control group, treatment with unopposed transdermal\n17beta-estradiol caused a significant decrease in HOMA-IR, that is, improved\ninsulin sensitivity, but after combination with MPA and 12 months of HRT, no\nchange was observed in HOMA-IR. Similarly, a transient decrease was observed for \nplasma levels of C peptide after unopposed 17beta-estradiol. HOMA-BCF remained\nunchanged throughout the study period. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was\nrelated to HOMA-IR but not to HOMA-BCF at baseline. The association with HOMA-IR \ngrew stronger after unopposed transdermal estradiol. No deleterious effect of HRT\non glucose metabolism was found in postmenopausal women with CAD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment with unopposed transdermal estradiol caused a\ndecrease in insulin resistance, but long-term treatment after intermittent MPA\nwas introduced had no effect on either insulin secretion or insulin resistance.\n\nPMID: 15775731  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hormone therapy (HT) may reduce fasting plasma\nhomocysteine levels. We studied 80 postmenopausal women to determine the effect\nof medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) combined with conjugated equine estrogens\n(CEE) on fasting plasma homocysteine levels.\nDESIGN: In a randomized, double blind, prospective, placebo-controlled study, we \nrandomly assigned 80 healthy postmenopausal women between CEE 0.625 mg/d combined\nwith MPA 2.5 mg/d (n = 20), CEE 0.625 mg/d combined with MPA 5 mg/d (n = 20),\nunopposed CEE 0.625 mg/d (n = 20), and placebo (n = 20) all given for a duration \nof 6 months. Fasting plasma homocysteine levels were measured before and at the\nend of the treatment.\nRESULTS: Before treatment, plasma homocysteine concentrations were similar in all\ngroups. After 6 months of unopposed CEE, the mean fasting plasma homocysteine\nlevels decreased by 19.02% when compared with baseline levels (P < 0.05). The\nmean fasting plasma homocysteine concentrations decreased by 17.63% and 19.56%\nfrom baseline in both the CEE plus MPA 2.5 mg/d and CEE plus MPA 5 mg/d groups,\nrespectively (P < 0.05 for each group). In contrast, plasma homocysteine levels\nincreased by 11.66% in the placebo group. The homocysteine lowering effect did\nnot differ significantly among the three groups of women receiving unopposed CEE \nalone and CEE plus MPA at two different doses.\nCONCLUSION: Six months of estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen\ntherapy (EPT) significantly lower fasting plasma homocysteine levels in healthy\npostmenopausal women with equal efficacy.\n\nPMID: 15772570  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We investigated \nthe effect of 12-month hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on hemostatic factors in\nmild to moderate essential hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 38 hypertensive and 32 normotensive\npostmenopausal women received HRT (conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily) for 12 months, and 19 hypertensive and \n15 normotensive postmenopausal women did not. All hypertensive women had been\nadministered antihypetensive drugs before the start of the study. Hemostatic\nfactors, i.e., fibrogen, antithrombin, protein C activity, plasminogen activator \ninhibitor-1, D-dimer, and plasminogen, were measured in plasma of all women\nbefore, and 6 and 12 months after the start of study.\nRESULT: The antithrombin levels of the hypertensive and normotensive women who\nreceived HRT had decreased at 6 (both P<0.001) and 12 months (P<0.001 and P<0.01)\nand their D-dimer at 12 months (both P<0.05) and plasminogen levels at 6 (both\nP<0.001) and 12 months (both P<0.001) has increased, but other hemostatic factors\nwere unchanged. There were no changes in hemostatic factors in either control\ngroup.\nCONCLUSION: HRT for 12 months activated blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in\nboth hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women. Administration of CEE\nplus MPA therapy to hypertensive or normotensive postmenopausal women may be\nrelated to the thromboembolic events.\n\nPMID: 15733968  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There were no significant\ndifferences in the baseline demographics of women receiving hormone therapy\n(0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5mg of medroxyprogesterone\nacetate for women who had not had a hysterectomy) or placebo; or vitamins (400 IU\nof Vitamin E and 500 mg of Vitamin C twice daily) or placebo. Baseline FMD was\nimpaired in all subjects (3.3+/-7.6%). Neither hormone therapy (4.1+/-5.2% at\nbaseline, 4.2+/-5.0% at 3 months, and 4.1+/-6.5% at 34 months) nor antioxidant\nvitamins (3.0+/-8.3% at baseline; 3.5+/-4.6% at 3 months; 3.1+/-7.6% at 34\nmonths) improved FMD (all p-values=NS). Endothelium-independent vasodilation,\ninduced by nitroglycerin (NTG) was similar at baseline and was not affected by\neither therapy. In univariate and multivariate analysis, neither hormone therapy \nnor antioxidant vitamins were associated with FMD.

To \nattempt to understand the lack of benefit in these trials, we have examined the\neffects of MP and two other progestogens, the less androgenic desogestrel (DG)\nand the more androgenic norethisterone (NE), on cardiovascular risk factors\nagainst a background of oestrogen therapy.\nDESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-four women were treated with conjugated equine\noestrogens (CEE) 0.625 mg daily alone for 12 weeks, followed in random order by\neach of the three progestogens (DG 75 microg, MP 10 mg and NE 1 mg daily) given\nsequentially for three 12-week cycles while maintaining the same CEE treatment.\nWe measured serum lipoproteins, paraoxonase activity, C-reactive protein (CRP),\nfibrinogen, fasting glucose and insulin levels at baseline, at the end of the\noestrogen-only phase and at the end of each of the combined oestrogen and\nprogestogen phases.\nRESULTS: The addition of progestogens to CEE maintained the oestrogen-induced\nreduction in apolipoprotein B (apo B) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and further\nlowered total cholesterol (P < 0.01) and fibrinogen (P < 0.001). CEE raised serum\ntriglyceride (P < 0.001) and CRP (P < 0.01) concentrations, which reverted\ntowards pre-oestrogen levels with progestogens. Progestogens significantly\nreduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P < 0.05). NE was associated \nwith the greatest reduction in HDL cholesterol and apo A1, but was most effective\nin preserving paraoxonase activity and reducing the potentially unfavourable\noestrogen-induced increases in triglycerides and CRP.\nCONCLUSION: Preconceptions that more androgenic progestogens necessarily have\nmore unfavourable effects on cardiovascular risk factors may require revision.\n\nPMID: 15579192  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, mechanisms for this association remain unclear. In this\nstudy, we examined the relationship between pulse pressure and the progression of\ncoronary atherosclerosis and the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on \npulse pressure in postmenopausal women with angiographically confirmed coronary\ndisease followed for 3.2 years in the Estrogen Replacement in Atherosclerosis\n(ERA) trial. In the ERA trial, 309 postmenopausal women (mean age 66+/-7 years)\nwith coronary disease were randomized to estrogen, estrogen plus progestin, or\nplacebo, and followed for 3.2 years. Ten standardized epicardial segments were\nmeasured for minimal diameter values at baseline and follow-up using quantitative\ncoronary angiography. For this study, mixed-model analysis of covariance was used\nto: (1) test the association between pulse pressure and change in mean minimum\ndiameter (MMD) adjusted for baseline MMD and (2) the effect of HRT on follow-up\npulse pressure. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was a\nsignificant graded increase in progression of coronary stenosis with increasing\nquartiles of baseline pulse pressure (P test for trend=0.0001). The progression\nrate in women with the highest quartile of baseline pulse pressure was 5-fold\nhigher than in women in the lowest quartile (P<0.01). In postmenopausal women\nwith coronary disease, increased levels of baseline pulse pressure are associated\nwith subsequent progression of coronary atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. \nHRT had no detectable effect on pulse pressure.\n\nPMID: 15545509  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Vascular reactivity (VR - % of vessel diameter variation in\nthe fasting period and 2 hours after meals) was measured by using the automated\nultrasound method. Lipid profile and glycemia during the fasting period and 2\nhours after a high-fat meal were measured.\nRESULTS: With placebo, vascular reactivity (VR) decreased from 3.20 +/- 17%\nduring the fasting period to -2.1 +/- 30% 2 hours after the meal (P = 0.041).\nWith the hormone replacement therapy, vascular reactivity decreased from 6.14 +/-\n27% during the fasting period to - 0.05 +/- 18% 2 hours after the meal (P = NS). \nPostprandial triglyceridemia increased as follows: 35 +/- 25% with placebo; and\n12 +/- 10% with hormone replacement therapy (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: In postmenopausal hypertensive women, 2 weeks of hormone replacement \nwith an association of estrogens and progestogens decreased hypertriglyceridemia \nafter a high-fat meal, an effect that may reduce the endothelial dysfunction\noccurring in the postprandial period.\n\nPMID: 15543358  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The aim of this study was to evaluate\nendothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilatation in the brachial artery and\nplasma levels of nitrite, nitrate and endothelin-1 in 20 postmenopausal women\nwith increased cardiovascular risk treated with either HRT or raloxifene for 4\nweeks in a randomized double-blind single cross-over study. Patients had an\nendothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation of 4% prior to initiation of the\nstudy. Treatment with HRT resulted in a 67% increase in dilatation compared with \nbaseline (from a 7.4% increase to a 12.4% increase, p < 0.01). Raloxifene\ntreatment resulted in no change in vasodilatation from baseline.\nEndothelium-dependent dilatation was significantly improved by HRT compared with \nraloxifene treatment (12.4+/-0.6% vs. 6.1+/-2.0%; p < 0.01). Compared with\nbaseline values, nitrate plus nitrite levels increased significantly (p < 0.05)\nwith HRT but not with raloxifene. Similarly, endothelin-1 decreased from baseline\nwith both treatments, but only the HRT-induced decrease was statistically\nsignificant (p < 0.05). In conclusion, HRT improved endothelial function and\nreduced plasma levels of endothelin-1 in postmenopausal women at risk of coronary\nartery disease. These beneficial effects were not shared by raloxifene.\n\nPMID: 15497491  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 28 and 52\nweeks of treatment. Participants received daily oral treatment with continuous\ncombined 1 mg micronised 17 beta-oestradiol/5 mg dydrogesterone (E/D: n=180) or\n0.625 mg conjugated equine oestrogens/5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA: \nn=182).\nRESULTS: Significant differences between the two groups after 52 weeks were\nobserved for total cholesterol (E/D: -1.7%; CEE/MPA: -7.3%), LDL-cholesterol\n(E/D: -4.5%; CEE/MPA: -11.3%), HDL-cholesterol (E/D: +15.3%; CEE/MPA: +7.5%),\ntriglycerides (E/D: +9.8%; CEE/MPA: +16.6%), VLDL-triglycerides (E/D: -3.3%;\nCEE/MPA: +10.0%), lipoprotein(a) (E/D: 0.0%; CEE/MPA: -25.2%) and for the ratio\napolipoprotein B/LDL-cholesterol (E/D: +0.9%; CEE/MPA +5.9%).\nCONCLUSIONS: E/D and CEE/MPA differ in their anti-atherogenic effects on lipids\nand lipoproteins. This however can not easily be translated to differences in\nclinical cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nPMID: 15488354  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Baseline gene variants related to thrombosis\nrisk were measured in the first 147 women who developed thrombosis and in 513\ncontrols.\nINTERVENTION: Random assignment to 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus \n2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate, or placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Centrally validated deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary\nembolus.\nRESULTS: Venous thrombosis occurred in 167 women taking estrogen plus progestin\n(3.5 per 1000 person-years) and in 76 taking placebo (1.7 per 1000 person-years);\nhazard ratio (HR), 2.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-2.70). Compared with \nwomen between the ages of 50 and 59 years who were taking placebo, the risk\nassociated with hormone therapy was higher with age: HR of 4.28 (95% CI,\n2.38-7.72) for women aged 60 to 69 years and 7.46 (95% CI, 4.32-14.38) for women \naged 70 to 79 years. Compared with women who were of normal weight and taking\nplacebo, the risk associated with taking estrogen plus progestin was increased\namong overweight and obese women: HR of 3.80 (95% CI, 2.08-6.94) and 5.61 (95%\nCI, 3.12-10.11), respectively. Factor V Leiden enhanced the hormone-associated\nrisk of thrombosis with a 6.69-fold increased risk compared with women in the\nplacebo group without the mutation (95% CI, 3.09-14.49). Other genetic variants\n(prothrombin 20210A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, factor XIII\nVal34Leu, PAI-1 4G/5G, and factor V HR2) did not modify the association of\nhormone therapy with venous thrombosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin was associated with doubling the risk of\nvenous thrombosis. Estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the risks associated\nwith age, overweight or obesity, and factor V Leiden.\n\nPMID: 15467059  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Plasma lipid\nlevels were studied for CEE (n = 49), CEE + MPA (n = 50) and tibolone (n = 51).\nMean per cent changes at certain intervals were compared with their previous\nintervals for each therapy. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. CEE \nalone had raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride levels and\nlowered total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels at the end of \nthe 2-year study period. Addition of MPA to the CEE regimen weakened the effect\non HDL and triglyceride, augmented the decrease in total cholesterol and did not \naffect LDL. The tibolone group revealed similar but more prominent effects in\ntotal cholesterol and LDL levels. HDL and triglyceride levels were significantly \nbelow baseline in the first 6 months, but HDL changes vanished and triglyceride\nlevels remained decreased at the end of 2 years. These data did not support a\ncorrelation between lipid levels and the biphasic incidence of cardiac events\nthat were observed in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), \nbut revealed period-dependent changes in the tibolone group.\n\nPMID: 15293891  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2004 Jun 28.\n\nPostmenopausal hormone therapy is associated with atherosclerosis progression in \nwomen with abnormal glucose tolerance.\n\nHoward BV(1), Hsia J, Ouyang P, Van Voorhees L, Lindsay J, Silverman A, Alderman \nEL, Tripputi M, Waters DD.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)MedStar Research Institute, 6495 New Hampshire Ave, Suite 201, Hyattsville, MD\n20783, USA. Barbara.V.Howard@MedStar.net\n\nBACKGROUND: Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT; diabetes or impaired glucose\ntolerance) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease,\nespecially in women. Cardiovascular disease rates in women increase after\nmenopause. The Women's Health Initiative found that postmenopausal hormone\ntherapy (PHT) increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and that effects in\ndiabetic women did not differ from those in women without diabetes. In this\nstudy, we hypothesized that PHT would have a worse effect on disease among women \nwith AGT.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 423 postmenopausal women with\nangiographically defined atherosclerosis (321 women had exit angiograms) with\n(n=140) or without (n=181) AGT to receive estrogen, estrogen plus progestin, or a\nplacebo for 2.8+/-0.9 years. LDL was lower and HDL and triglycerides were higher \nafter PHT in non-AGT and AGT women, but more adverse changes occurred in\nC-reactive protein and fibrinogen in women with AGT (P=0.11 and P=0.02 for\ninteractions). PHT had no effect on fasting glucose or insulin concentrations in \nwomen without AGT, but in women with AGT, fasting glucose levels, insulin\nconcentration, and insulin resistance as assessed by the HOMA (homeostasis model)\ncalculation decreased slightly (P=0.28, P=0.25, P=0.14 for interaction,\nrespectively). Atherosclerotic progression was greater in women with AGT.\nAtherosclerotic progression in previously nondiseased segments was enhanced by\nPHT to a greater extent in women with AGT (P=0.11 for interaction).\nCONCLUSIONS: PHT is associated with a worsening of coronary atherosclerosis and\nexacerbation of the profile of inflammatory markers in women with AGT. Therefore,\nPHT is not warranted for use in diabetic women. Further study is needed to\nexplore the improvement in insulin resistance and glycemia that appears to occur \nwith PHT in women with AGT.\n\nPMID: 15226212  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

All of the\npostmenopausal women (n = 279) received sequential conjugated equine estrogen\n(CEE) at a dose of 0.625 mg/day for 25 days (days 1-25) of each month. These\nwomen were also randomly assigned to receive either dydrogesterone 10 mg/day (E +\nD group, n = 140) or MPA 5 mg/day (E + P group, n = 139) for 14 days (days 12-25)\nof each month. Serum biochemical markers, lipoproteins, plasma prothrombin time\n(PT), partial prothrombin time (PPT) and antithrombin III-antigen (ATIII-Ag) were\nanalyzed at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months of treatment.\nRESULTS: Liver function, renal function, PT and PPT did not change significantly \nduring the 12-month trial. The E + D group had a more pronounced increase in high\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than the E + P group (10.6% vs. 2.7%)\nafter 12 months of treatment (p < 0.05). Both groups showed reduced\nconcentrations of total cholesterol (T-CHO), low density lipoprotein cholesterol \n(LDL-C) and ATIII, whereas triglyceride (TG) was increased at the end of the\ntrial (without intergroup difference).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a favorable effect on lipoprotein profiles\nwith both hormone replacement therapy regimens. Dydrogesterone appears to be\nsuperior to medroxyprogesterone acetate from the perspective of modification of\ncoronary heart disease risk factors.\n\nPMID: 15225192  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Estrogen \nwith progestin did not reduce peripheral arterial events among women with\npreexisting coronary heart disease. This analysis evaluates clinical peripheral\narterial disease among generally healthy women in the Women's Health Initiative\nrandomized trial of estrogen plus progestin.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The Estrogen Plus Progestin trial assigned 16 608\npostmenopausal women, mean age 63.3+/-7.1 years, to daily conjugated estrogens\n(0.625 mg) with medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) or placebo and documented\nhealth outcomes over an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Hospitalization for\nperipheral arterial disease was infrequent, with annualized rates of 0.08%,\n0.06%, and 0.02% for carotid disease, lower extremity arterial disease, and\nabdominal aortic aneurysm, respectively. The incidence of peripheral arterial\nevents did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95%\nconfidence interval 0.63, 1.25). The risk was slightly greater among women\nassigned to active estrogen with progestin in years 1 (HR 1.33) and 2 (HR 1.27), \nand was slightly lower in later years (HR 0.85 and 0.87 in years 5 and > or =6). \nAmong adherent participants, the hazard ratio for peripheral arterial events was \n1.23 (95% confidence interval 0.79, 1.91) over the 5.6 years of follow up.\nSubgroup analysis identified no significant interactions between estrogen with\nprogestin and baseline characteristics with regard to peripheral arterial disease\nrisk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among generally healthy postmenopausal women, conjugated estrogens\nwith progestin did not confer protection against peripheral arterial disease.\n\nPMID: 14769684  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Leptin was related to lipid fractions (high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol: r = -0.33, p < 0.001; apolipoprotein A: r = -0.28, p = 0.004; and\ntriglycerides: r = 0.27, p = 0.003) and indices of glucose metabolism (C-peptide:\nr = 0.47, p < 0.001; fasting insulin: r = 0.42, p < 0.001; glucose: r = 0.25, p =\n0.008; insulin resistance: r = 0.45, p < 0.001; and insulin secretion: r = 0.36, \np < 0.001). In a multiple regression model, only body mass index (p < 0.001) and \nC-peptide (p = 0.002) remained as independent factors for leptin levels. Despite \nthe association with sex hormone-binding globulin (r = 0.30, p = 0.001), no\neffect on leptin levels was observed with either unopposed transdermal estradiol \nor estradiol combined with MPA.\nCONCLUSION: Plasma leptin is related to other cardiovascular risk factors in\npostmenopausal women with CAD, but seems to be unaffected by transdermal\n17beta-estradiol administration.\n\nPMID: 14567768  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A total of 378 volunteers from four centers\n(Bangkok, Hangzhou, Santiago and Singapore) were monitored. Blood sampling took\nplace in one pretreatment cycle, the third and ninth injection intervals and one \nposttreatment cycle. In each of the three treatment groups, a rise in hemoglobin,\nand increases in platelet count and in prothrombin time were observed. With\ntreatment there was a significant increase in activated partial thromboplastin\ntime among Mesigyna users, no change among Cyclofem users and a significant\ndecrease among OC users. OC use led to increases in plasma levels of fibrinogen, \nfactor VII, factor X, plasminogen, protein C and decreases in plasma levels of\nt-PAI and antithrombin. Use of combined injectables induced no change (Cyclofem) \nor decreases (Mesigyna) in plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, factor X and \nantithrombin. Use of both combined injectables led to decreases in protein C,\nslight decreases in plasminogen and increases in plasminogen and fibrinogen.\nOverall, the injectable preparations may be more beneficial than the oral\npreparation in not enhancing a hypercoagulable state because of the reduced\nsynthesis of fibrinogen, factors VII and X; however, decreases in antithrombin\nand protein C, which are potent coagulation inhibitors, may raise some concern.\nWhether these changes can lead to modifications in the risk of arterial or venous\ndisease can only be ascertained by conducting epidemiological studies.\n\nPMID: 14561536  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2003 Aug 21.\n\nSignificant differential effects of hormone therapy or tibolone on markers of\ncardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women: a randomized, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled, crossover study.\n\nKoh KK(1), Ahn JY, Jin DK, Yoon BK, Kim HS, Kim DS, Kang WC, Han SH, Choi IS,\nShin EK.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Cardiology, Gil Heart Center, Gachon Medical School, Namdong-gu,\nIncheon, Korea. kwangk@ghil.com\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the effects of tibolone and hormone\ntherapy (HT) on lipid profile, vasodilation, and factors associated with\ninflammation and hemostasis.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-three women received micronized progesterone (MP, 100 \nmg) with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE, 0.625 mg) or tibolone (2.5 mg) daily\nfor 2 months, with a 2-month washout period. Compared with HT, tibolone\nsignificantly reduced total cholesterol (P<0.001), triglyceride (P<0.001), and\nHDL cholesterol (P<0.001) levels as well as triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratios\n(P<0.001) but not LDL cholesterol levels. Tibolone significantly improved\nflow-mediated brachial artery dilator response to hyperemia from baseline values \n(P<0.001) by a magnitude similar to that found with HT (P=0.628). Compared with\ntibolone, which showed no changes, HT significantly increased high-sensitivity\nC-reactive protein (hsCRP, P=0.030) and reduced antithrombin III (P<0.001). HT\nand tibolone significantly increased prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) from\nbaseline values (P<0.001 and P=0.004, respectively). The effects of HT and\ntibolone on hsCRP, antithrombin III, and F1+2 were significantly different. HT\nand tibolone significantly reduced plasma levels of plasminogen activator\ninhibitor type 1 antigen from baseline levels (P=0.006 and P=0.005, respectively)\nto a similar degree (P=0.988).\nCONCLUSIONS: Tibolone significantly improved flow-mediated brachial artery\ndilator response by a magnitude similar to that found with CEE+MP; however,\ntibolone did not significantly change hsCRP and antithrombin III, and tibolone\nincreased F1+2 less than did CEE+MP.\n\nPMID: 12933531  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Whether\n17beta-estradiol (the endogenous estrogen molecule) alone or administered\nsequentially with medroxyprogesterone acetate can slow the progression of\natherosclerosis is unknown.\nMETHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 226\npostmenopausal women (mean age, 63.5 years) who had at least one coronary-artery \nlesion. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care (control group),\nestrogen therapy with micronized 17beta-estradiol alone (estrogen group), or\n17beta-estradiol plus sequentially administered medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(estrogen-progestin group). In all patients the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\ncholesterol level was reduced to a target of less than 130 mg per deciliter. The \nprimary outcome was the average per-participant change between base-line and\nfollow-up coronary angiograms in the percent stenosis measured by quantitative\ncoronary angiography.\nRESULTS: After a median of 3.3 years of follow-up, the mean (+/-SE) change in the\npercent stenosis in the 169 participants who had a pair of matched angiograms was\n1.89+/-0.78 percentage points in the control group, 2.18+/-0.76 in the estrogen\ngroup, and 1.24+/-0.80 in the estrogen-progestin group (P=0.66 for the comparison\namong the three groups). The mean difference in the percent stenosis between the \nestrogen group and the control group was 0.29 percentage point (95 percent\nconfidence interval, -1.88 to 2.46), and the mean difference between the\nestrogen-progestin group and the control group was -0.65 (95 percent confidence\ninterval, -2.87 to 1.57).\nCONCLUSIONS: In older postmenopausal women with established coronary-artery\natherosclerosis, 17beta-estradiol either alone or with sequentially administered \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate had no significant effect on the progression of\natherosclerosis.\n\nCopyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society\n\nPMID: 12904518  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In this report, we provide the final results with\nregard to estrogen plus progestin and CHD from the Women's Health Initiative\n(WHI).\nMETHODS: The WHI included a randomized primary-prevention trial of estrogen plus \nprogestin in 16,608 postmenopausal women who were 50 to 79 years of age at base\nline. Participants were randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine estrogens \n(0.625 mg per day) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg per day) or placebo. \nThe primary efficacy outcome of the trial was CHD (nonfatal myocardial infarction\nor death due to CHD).\nRESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years (planned duration, 8.5 years), the\ndata and safety monitoring board recommended terminating the\nestrogen-plus-progestin trial because the overall risks exceeded the benefits.\nCombined hormone therapy was associated with a hazard ratio for CHD of 1.24\n(nominal 95 percent confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.54; 95 percent confidence\ninterval after adjustment for sequential monitoring, 0.97 to 1.60). The elevation\nin risk was most apparent at one year (hazard ratio, 1.81 [95 percent confidence \ninterval, 1.09 to 3.01]). Although higher base-line levels of low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol were associated with an excess risk of CHD among women\nwho received hormone therapy, higher base-line levels of C-reactive protein,\nother biomarkers, and other clinical characteristics did not significantly modify\nthe treatment-related risk of CHD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin does not confer cardiac protection and may\nincrease the risk of CHD among generally healthy postmenopausal women, especially\nduring the first year after the initiation of hormone use. This treatment should \nnot be prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nCopyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society\n\nPMID: 12904517  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In the present study, we examined the effects of HRT on\noffice BP and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in Japanese hypertensive or\nnormotensive PMW. Thirty-one hypertensive (HT-HRT group) and 17 normotensive PMW \n(NT-HRT group) received HRT (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen combined with\n2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate) orally for 12 months, and 30 hypertensive \n(HT-Control group) and 19 normotensive PMW (NT-Control group) did not receive\nHRT. In all of the hypertensive PMW, BP was controlled by a variety of\nantihypertensive drugs before starting HRT. The hypertensive PMW were divided\ninto two groups according to the results of ABP before HRT: nondippers (those\nwithout a diurnal change in BP) and dippers (those with a diurnal change in BP). \nIn all patients, office BP measurements and 24-h ABPM were performed before and\n12 months after the start of HRT. HRT did not change either the office or the\n24-h ambulatory systolic, diastolic, or mean BP in any of the groups. Therefore, \nHRT did not significantly alter the proportion of nondippers. We conclude that\nwith respect to BP, HRT might not be harmful in hypertensive PMW whose BP has\nbeen well-controlled prior to the initiation of HRT, as well as in normotensive\nPMW.\n\nPMID: 12887127  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, the precise mechanism underlying its benefits\nis unclear. This question was addressed in an electron spin resonance (EPR) study\nof membrane function of erythrocytes in postmenopausal women. The purpose of this\nstudy was to investigate the effects of HRT on membrane fluidity of erythrocytes \nin postmenopausal women by means of the EPR and spin-labeling method.\nMETHODS: The healthy postmenopausal women were randomly divided into the HRT\ngroup (n = 14) receiving the conjugated estrogen with medroxyprogesterone for 3\nmonths and the non-HRT control group (n = 14). We measured membrane fluidity of\nerythrocytes in postmenopausal women before and after the trial period.\nRESULTS: The HRT group showed a significant decrease in blood pressure (BP) after\ntreatment (systolic BP 145.7 +/- 5.5 v 123.3 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, n = 14, mean +/- SEM,\nP <.05). The order parameter (S) for 5-nitroxide stearate in the EPR spectra of\nerythrocyte membranes decreased significantly in the HRT group (S: 0.718 +/-\n0.002 v 0.695 +/- 0.002, n = 14, P <.01). The finding indicated that HRT\nincreased the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes and improved the microviscosity\nof the cell membranes in postmenopausal women.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HRT might have\na beneficial effect on the membrane rheologic behavior of erythrocytes and the\nmicrocirculation in postmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 12799102  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We investigated whether the serum HGF level differs between\nhypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women (PMW) and whether hormone\nreplacement therapy (HRT) alters the serum HGF level and blood pressure in\nhypertensive and normotensive PMW.\nDESIGN: Prospective observational study.\nMETHODS: A total of 33 PMW with mild to moderate essential hypertension\ncontrolled by antihypertensive treatment (mean age, 57 +/- 6 years) and 23\nnormotensive PMW (mean age, 57 +/- 7 years) received continuous HRT (0.625 mg of \nconjugated equine estrogen combined with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate)\nonce a day orally for 12 months, and we measured serum HGF levels and blood\npressure before and 12 months after the start of HRT.\nRESULTS: The baseline serum HGF level was significantly higher in hypertensive\nPMW than in normotensive PMW. HRT significantly decreased the serum HGF level in \nhypertensive subjects, from 2.85 +/- 0.64 pmol/l to 2.49 +/- 0.65 pmol/l (P <\n0.001), but not in normotensive subjects. HRT did not change blood pressure in\neither group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum HGF level before the start of HRT was higher in the\nhypertensive PMW than in the normotensive PMW. Furthermore, HRT decreases serum\nHGF without decreasing blood pressure in hypertensive PMW. The HRT-induced\ndecrease in serum HGF was greater in hypertensive PMW than in normotensive PMW,\nand the decrease was independent of blood pressure changes.\n\nPMID: 12777952  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and\nlipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and \n513 controls.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen\nplus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were\ncentrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and\n107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were\nischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat\nhazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence\ninterval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95%\nCI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for\nhemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate\nthat excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories \nof baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior\nhistory of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other\nrisk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use\nof vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white\nblood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of\nestrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in\ngenerally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to\nestrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women\nexamined.\n\nPMID: 12771114  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The ingestion of fish oil or other sources of n-3\npolyunsaturated fatty acids has been included in comprehensive strategies to\nprevent atherosclerosis. Many epidemiologic studies have shown that the dietary\nintake of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid has antiatherosclerotic \neffects. We investigated the effect of HRT on plasma docosahexaenoic acid and\neicosapentaenoic acid concentrations in postmenopausal women. Fifty-nine\npostmenopausal women, who received conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day) and\nmedroxyprogesterone (2.5 mg/day) for 12 months, and 45 control postmenopausal\nwomen, who did not receive HRT, volunteered to participate in this study. Plasma \ndocosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid concentrations were measured at\nbaseline and at 6 and 12 months after the start of HRT. HRT significantly\nincreased the plasma docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid\nconcentrations from 134 +/- 5 microg/ml and 69 +/- 4 microg/ml at baseline to 156\n+/- 7 microg/ml and 85 +/- 7 microg/ml after 12 months (both p<0.01). However,\nthe control group showed no significant change in their plasma docosahexaenoic\nacid and eicosapentaenoic acid levels during the study. HRT increased plasma\ndocosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid levels in postmenopausal women. We\npropose that the increase in docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid may\nbe partially responsible for the beneficial mechanisms by which HRT induces an\nantiatherosclerotic effect in postmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 12733709  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Remnant lipoprotein particles have been\nsuggested to be the most atherogenic particles among the triglyceride-rich\nlipoproteins. In particular, these triglyceride-rich particles were identified as\nan independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in women.\nPostmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) beneficially affects lipid\nprofile, although total triglyceride levels often increase. Evidence on the\neffects of HRT on RLPs is limited. We determined whether 3 months' treatment of\npostmenopausal women with Tibolone or conjugated oestrogens combined with\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE + MPA) affects RLP-cholesterol (RLP-C).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and five healthy postmenopausal women were\nrandomized to either 2.5 mg of Tibolone, 0.625 mg of CEE + 2.5 mg of MPA or\nplacebo. At baseline and after 3 months the lipid profile was determined. For\nassessment of RLP-C we used an immunoseparation-based method.\nRESULTS: Treatment with CEE + MPA significantly reduced RLP-C (-0.03 mmol L-1,\nP-value = 0.01) and appeared to increase triglycerides (0.15 mmol L-1, P-value = \n0.20) compared with placebo. Tibolone did not significantly change RLP-C (-0.01\nmmol L-1, P-value = 0.35) and significantly decreased triglycerides (-0.35 mmol\nL-1, P-value = 0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment of postmenopausal women with conjugated oestrogens and\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate reduced RLP-C, without a reduction in total\ntriglycerides, whereas Tibolone did affect triglyceride levels, but not RLP-C.\nThese observations may be relevant for explaining the effect of HRT on\ncardiovascular risk in healthy postmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 12713450  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

No trial has evaluated the effect of\nhormone therapy on diabetes incidence.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hormone therapy on fasting glucose level and\nincident diabetes.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING: 20 U.S. clinical centers.\nPARTICIPANTS: 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease who were\nfollowed for 4.1 years. At baseline, 734 women had diabetes, 218 women had\nimpaired fasting glucose, and 1811 women were normoglycemic; the 2029 women\nwithout diabetes were followed for incident diabetes.\nINTERVENTION: 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone \nacetate daily, or placebo.\nMEASUREMENTS: Fasting glucose level was measured at baseline, at year 1, and at\nthe end of the trial. Incident diabetes was defined by self-report of diabetes or\ndisease complication, fasting glucose level of 6.9 mmol/L or greater (> or =126\nmg/dL), or initiation of therapy with diabetes medication.\nRESULTS: Fasting glucose levels increased significantly among women assigned to\nplacebo but did not change among women receiving hormone therapy. The incidence\nof diabetes was 6.2% in the hormone therapy group and 9.5% in the placebo group\n(relative hazard, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89]; P = 0.006). The number needed to\ntreat for benefit to prevent one case of diabetes was 30 (CI, 18 to 103). Changes\nin weight and waist circumference did not mediate this effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: In women with coronary disease, hormone therapy reduced the\nincidence of diabetes by 35%. This observation provides important insights into\nthe metabolic effects of postmenopausal hormones but is insufficient to recommend\nthe use of hormones for secondary prevention of heart disease.\n\nPMID: 12513038  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The frequency and severity \nof such symptoms and response to hormone therapy in older women have not been\nwell documented.\nMETHODS: We used data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a \nblinded, clinical trial among 2763 women with documented coronary disease and a\nuterus who were randomized to receive either conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg in one tablet or placebo. Participants were\nqueried at baseline and annually regarding menopausal symptoms. Breast symptoms\nwere self-reported, and uterine bleeding was recorded on a daily diary.\nRESULTS: Symptoms associated with menopause were relatively common among Heart\nand Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study participants, whose average age was 67\nyears and who averaged 18 years since menopause. At baseline, 16% of women\nreported frequent hot flashes, 26% vaginal dryness, 10% genital irritation, 55%\ntrouble sleeping, and 53% early awakening. Women assigned to hormone therapy\nreported less frequent hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and trouble sleeping\ncompared with women assigned to placebo, but more frequent vaginal discharge,\ngenital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms. The reporting of\nbreast symptoms among women in the hormone group decreased from 40% at 1 year to \n13% by the 4th year. Uterine bleeding was reported by 31% and spotting by an\nadditional 33% of women in the hormone group during the 1st year of treatment; by\nthe 4th year, these proportions had fallen to 11% and 20%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Symptoms typically attributed to menopause are common in elderly\nwomen. Postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces hot flashes, trouble sleeping, and \nvaginal dryness, but at standard doses in elderly women is associated with\nvaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms.\n\nPMID: 12468165  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Women were assigned randomly to conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg) plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) in one tablet daily or identical placebo;\nthey were followed for a mean (+/- SD) of 4.2 +/- 0.4 years. Participants at 10\nof the 20 HERS centers were invited to enroll in the cognitive function substudy.\nAt the end of the trial, we measured cognitive function in 517 women in the\nhormone group and 546 in the placebo group using six standard tests: the modified\nMini-Mental Status Examination, Verbal Fluency, Boston Naming, Word List Memory, \nWord List Recall, and Trails B. Cognitive function was not measured at baseline.\nRESULTS: The mean age of participants at the time of cognitive function testing\nwas 71 +/- 6 years. There were no differences in age-adjusted cognitive function \ntest scores between the two treatment groups, except that women assigned to\nhormones scored worse on the Verbal Fluency test than women assigned to placebo\n(15.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 16.6 +/- 4.8, P = 0.02). Adjustment for other potential\nconfounders and restriction of the analyses to women who had been adherent to\nstudy medication did not change the results.\nCONCLUSION: Among older postmenopausal women with coronary disease, 4 years of\ntreatment with postmenopausal hormone therapy did not result in better cognitive \nfunction as measured on six standardized tests. Whether these results also apply \nto elderly women without coronary disease cannot be determined from this study.\n\nPMID: 12459399  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In such women the arterial intima can express tissue factor, and changes\nin coagulation factor VII (factor VII) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)\nmay be deleterious.\nMETHODS: We measured factor VII clotting activity, activated factor VII, and\nconcentrations of factor VII and TFPI during 12 months in healthy post-menopausal\nwomen randomized to: (i). cyclic oral estrogen/progestin (n = 25); (ii).\nlong-cycle oral estrogen/quarterly progestin (n = 32); (iii). continuous oral\nestrogen/progestin (n = 21); (iv). continuous oral estrogen/intrauterine\nprogestin (n = 22); (v). no HRT (n = 26). Blood was collected at baseline, 3, 6\nand 12 months. Additional sampling was done before progestin intake in the long\ncycle group.\nRESULTS: No variations were observed in the reference group. There was a\nsubstantial decrease in TFPI concentrations in the HRT groups irrespective of the\ntype of progestin. In women receiving long-cycle treatment, all factor VII\nmeasures increased during the unopposed estrogen periods, and the increase was\nreversed after progestin intake. The integrated response, AUC, for TFPI was\nsignificantly lower in the HRT groups compared with the reference group.\nCONCLUSION: The observed changes may increase the early thrombotic risk\nassociated with HRT use.\n\nPMID: 12456630  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\ntrial was conducted from July 1997 to January 2002 in 7 clinical centers in the\nUnited States and Canada.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to\nreceive either 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (plus 2.5 mg/d of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate for women who had not had a hysterectomy), or\nmatching placebo, and 400 IU of vitamin E twice daily plus 500 mg of vitamin C\ntwice daily, or placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Annualized mean (SD) change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD)\nfrom baseline to concluding angiogram of all qualifying coronary lesions averaged\nfor each patient. Patients with intercurrent death or myocardial infarction (MI) \nwere imputed the worst rank of angiographic outcome.\nRESULTS: The mean (SD) interval between angiograms was 2.8 (0.9) years. Coronary \nprogression, measured in mean (SD) change, worsened with HRT by 0.047 (0.15) mm/y\nand by 0.024 (0.15) mm/y with HRT placebo (P =.17); and for antioxidant vitamins \nby 0.044 (0.15) mm/y and with vitamin placebo by 0.028 (0.15) mm/y (P =.32). When\npatients with intercurrent death or MI were included, the primary outcome showed \nan increased risk for women in the active HRT group (P =.045), and suggested an\nincreased risk in the active vitamin group (P =.09). Fourteen patients died in\nthe HRT group and 8 in the HRT placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 0.75-4.3), and 16 in the vitamin group and 6 in the\nvitamin placebo group (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.2). Death, nonfatal MI, or stroke\noccurred in 26 HRT patients vs 15 HRT controls (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.97-3.6) and in\n26 vitamin patients and 18 vitamin controls (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.80-2.9). There\nwas no interaction between the 2 treatment interventions.\nCONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women with coronary disease, neither HRT nor\nantioxidant vitamin supplements provide cardiovascular benefit. Instead, a\npotential for harm was suggested with each treatment.\n\nPMID: 12435256  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

J Am Med Womens Assoc. 2002 Fall;57(4):215-6.\n\nTime trends in the HERS secondary prevention trial: much ado about nothing?\n\nDerry PS.\n\nThe Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study was the first randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating whether hormone replacement\ntherapy (HRT) reduces the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and\ncoronary heart disease (CHD) death. The main conclusion was that HRT provided no \nbenefit for secondary prevention. This paper examines the statistical evidence\nfor a subsidiary analysis suggesting that the effects of HRT varied over time;\nthat the HRT group had more cardiac events in year 1, but fewer by the last years\nof the study. An accurate reading of the HERS results indicates an increased\nincidence of MI and CHD death in the HRT group in year 1, but no evidence that\nthe HRT group had fewer CHD events by the end of the study.\n\nPMID: 12405240  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Free tissue factor pathway inhibitor antigen,\na circulating anticoagulant, is related to plasma homocysteine.\n\nOs I(1), Os A, Sandset PM, B\xc3\xb8lling S, Seljeflot I, Djurovic S, Westheim A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Ullev\xc3\xa5l University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.\ningrid.os@ioks.uio.no\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effect of hormone replacement\ntherapy (HRT) on plasma homocysteine levels in postmenopausal women with coronary\nartery disease (CAD) and to investigate associations of homocysteine to other\ncardiovascular risk factors.\nMETHODS: The women in this single-center, controlled, and randomized study were\nexamined at baseline, and after 3 and 12 months, after they had been recruited\nconsecutively from patients referred for investigational coronary angiography.\nAll analyses were performed examiner blind. They were randomized to HRT\nconsisting of transdermal application of continuous 17beta-estradiol with cyclic \nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) tablets for 14 days every 3rd month, or to a\ncontrol group.\nRESULTS: After 3 months of unopposed 17beta-estradiol, no significant effect on\nhomocysteine was observed compared to the control group. The absolute decrease of\n5% in median plasma homocysteine levels after 12-month HRT did not reach\nstatistical significance. Plasma homocysteine seemed slightly higher in women\nwith three- or four-vessel disease, but the difference was not significant. With \nincreasing homocysteine levels, free tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)\nantigen increased, whereas E-selectin decreased. In women with diabetes or\nelevated blood glucose >6.0 mmol/l, plasma homocysteine was correlated to body\nmass index, C-peptide and insulin as well as age.\nCONCLUSION: Transdermal application of 17beta-estradiol and sequential MPA do not\naffect plasma homocysteine in women with established CAD. Plasma homocysteine is \nstable in women with CAD over time, and unless special intervention is\nundertaken, repetitive measurements are not necessary in this particular group of\nhigh-risk individuals. The circulating anticoagulant TEPI is related to plasma\nhomocysteine.\n\nCopyright 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel\n\nPMID: 12373040  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Study \nvariables were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.\nRESULTS: Eight women randomized to hormone replacement therapy and four women\nassigned to placebo group dropped out of the study. Plasma CRP increased (2.2\nmg/l, 95% confidence interval 0.3-4.1 mg/l) significantly (P = 0.02) in women\ntreated with HRT (n = 21) compared with placebo (n = 29) taking baseline CRP,\nbody mass index (BMI) and smoking status into account. Plasma levels of cell\nadhesion molecules, IL-6 and leucocyte count did not change significantly during \nthe study.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that oral HRT with conjugated equine\noestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate increases plasma CRP levels but not\nnecessarily global inflammatory activity in post-menopausal diabetic women. An\nincrease in plasma CRP may potentially increase risk of a cardiovascular event.\n\nPMID: 12358873  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Circulation. 2002 Sep 24;106(13):1646-51.\n\nLong-term use of contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate in young women\nimpairs arterial endothelial function assessed by cardiovascular magnetic\nresonance.\n\nSorensen MB(1), Collins P, Ong PJ, Webb CM, Hayward CS, Asbury EA, Gatehouse PD, \nElkington AG, Yang GZ, Kubba A, Pennell DJ.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Cardiovascular MR Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK.\n\nComment in\n    Circulation. 2003 Mar 11;107(9):e67-8; author reply e67-8.\n    Circulation. 2003 May 27;107(20):e197; author reply e197.\n\nBACKGROUND: Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) inhibits proliferation of\novarian follicles, resulting in anovulation and a decrease in circulating\nestrogen; the latter action is potentially disadvantageous to cardiovascular\nhealth. We therefore investigated the vascular effects of long-term contraceptive\nDMPA in young women.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent (hyperemia-induced flow-mediated\ndilatation [FMD]) and -independent (glyceryl trinitrate [GTN]) changes in\nbrachial artery area were measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance in 13 \namenorrheic DMPA users (>1 year use; mean age 29+/-4 years) and in 10 controls\n(mean age 30+/-4 years, P=0.25) with regular menstrual cycles after validation of\nthe technique. FMD and GTN responses were measured just before repeat MPA\ninjection and 48 hours later (n=12) in DMPA users and during menstruation and\nmidcycle (n=9) in controls. Serum-estradiol levels (S-estradiol) were measured at\nboth visits. FMD was reduced in DMPA users compared with controls during\nmenstruation (1.1% versus 8.0%, respectively P<0.01) without differences in GTN\nresponses. S-estradiol levels in DMPA users were significantly lower than in\ncontrols during menstruation (58 versus 96 pmol/L, P<0.01). High levels of\ncirculating MPA 48 hours after injection were not linked to an additional\nimpairment in FMD (2.0% versus 3.1%, P=0.23). Estradiol levels were significantly\ncorrelated to FMD (r=0.43, P<0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Endothelium-dependent arterial function measured by cardiovascular\nmagnetic resonance is impaired in chronic users of DMPA, and hypoestrogenism may \nbe the mechanism of action. DMPA might adversely affect cardiovascular health,\nand in particular its use in women with cardiovascular disease should be\nadditionally evaluated.\n\nPMID: 12270857  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We hypothesized that hypertensive and/or\noverweight women may be less likely to realize cardiovascular benefits from\nestrogen.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We administered micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg or\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)\n0.625 mg daily during 2 months to 35 hypertensive and/or overweight\npostmenopausal women with a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. With\nsignificant changes of lipoproteins, CEE+MP or MPA significantly improved\nflow-mediated dilation and reduced plasma E-selectin, intercellular adhesion\nmolecule type-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis\nfactor-alpha levels (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.021, P<0.001, and P<0.001 by ANOVA,\nrespectively), but not C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels. Of note, there\nwere no significant differences between each therapy regarding these effects.\nHowever, the magnitude of improvement of flow-mediated dilation in these women\nwas less than in healthy postmenopausal women and more than in diabetic\npostmenopausal women reported by our previous studies. The effects of CEE+MP or\nMPA on inflammatory markers were comparable to healthy postmenopausal women, but \nnot comparable to diabetic postmenopausal women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen combined with synthetic progestin significantly improved\nflow-mediated brachial artery dilator response and reduced inflammation markers\nin hypertensive and/or overweight women, comparable to estrogen combined with\nnatural progesterone.\n\nPMID: 12231566  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A global index summarizing the balance of risks and \nbenefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE),\nendometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other\ncauses.\nRESULTS: On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and\nsafety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin\nvs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the\nstopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic\nsupported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major\nclinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal \n95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286\ncases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85)\nwith 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63\n(0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases;\nhip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes,\n0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for\ncomposite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease\n(arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76\n(0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and\n1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000\nperson-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8\nmore strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk\nreductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer\nhip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index\nwas 19 per 10 000 person-years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen\nplus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US \nwomen. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit\nprofile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable \nintervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate\nthat this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of \nCHD.\n\nPMID: 12117397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The proportions with at least 80%\nadherence to hormones declined from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone\ngroup and increased from 0% (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thromboembolic events, biliary tract surgery, cancer,\nfracture, and total mortality.\nRESULTS: Comparing women assigned to hormone therapy with those assigned to\nplacebo, the unadjusted intention-to-treat relative hazard (RH) for venous\nthromboembolism declined from 2.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-5.04)\nduring HERS to 1.40 (95% CI, 0.64-3.05) during HERS II (P for time trend =.08);\nit was 2.08 overall for the 6.8 years (95% CI, 1.28-3.40), and 3 of the 73 women \nwith thromboembolism died within 30 days due to pulmonary embolism. The overall\nRH for biliary tract surgery was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.12-1.95); for any cancer, 1.19\n(95% CI, 0.95-1.50); and for any fracture, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.87-1.25).

However, in the hormone group, findings did\nsuggest a higher risk of CHD events during the first year, and a decreased risk\nduring years 3 to 5.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if the risk reduction observed in the later years of HERS\npersisted and resulted in an overall reduced risk of CHD events with additional\nyears of follow-up.\nDESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years'\nduration (HERS) and subsequent unblinded follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II)\nconducted at outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with CHD and average age of 67\nyears at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those surviving) consented to\nfollow-up in HERS II.\nINTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of\nconjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380), or\nplacebo (n = 1383) during HERS; open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at\npersonal physicians' discretion during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80%\nadherence to hormones declined from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone\ngroup, and increased from 0% (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction and\nCHD death. Secondary cardiovascular events were coronary revascularization,\nhospitalization for unstable angina or congestive heart failure, nonfatal\nventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and\nperipheral arterial disease.\nRESULTS: There were no significant decreases in rates of primary CHD events or\nsecondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone group\ncompared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall. The unadjusted\nrelative hazard (RH) for CHD events in HERS was 0.99 (95% confidence interval\n[CI], 0.81-1.22); HERS II, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77-1.29); and overall, 0.99\n(0.84-1.17). The overall RHs were similar after adjustment for potential\nconfounders and differential use of statins between treatment groups (RH, 0.97;\n95% CI, 0.82-1.14), and in analyses restricted to women who were adherent to\nrandomized treatment assignment (RH, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19).\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower rates of CHD events among women in the hormone group in the\nfinal years of HERS did not persist during additional years of follow-up. After\n6.8 years, hormone therapy did not reduce risk of cardiovascular events in women \nwith CHD. Postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used to reduce risk for\nCHD events in women with CHD.\n\nPMID: 12090862  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Furthermore, the effects of\nstatins plus hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on cardiovascular outcomes are\nuncertain.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We examined statin use, cardiovascular events, and total\nmortality in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a\nrandomized clinical trial of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo in\npostmenopausal women with heart disease (n=2763). A nonrandomized comparison of\nstatin users and nonusers revealed lower rates of the primary outcome, nonfatal\nmyocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death (relative hazard [RH]=0.79,\n95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.63 to 0.99, P=0.04), and total mortality\n(RH=0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87, P=0.003). Rates of venous thromboembolic events\nwere also lower among statin users (RH=0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.88, P=0.02). HRT\nresulted in a significant increase in early risk for primary events in women who \ndid not use statins (RH=1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.03, P=0.04) but not in statin\nusers (RH=1.34, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.86, P=0.45). Adjustment for postrandomization\nstatin use showed no effect of HRT on risk for the primary outcome (RH=0.96, 95% \nCI 0.77 to 1.29; P=0.72).\nCONCLUSIONS: In HERS, statin use was associated with lower rates of\ncardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events, and total mortality. These\ndata provide strong support for statin use in eligible women with coronary\ndisease.\n\nPMID: 12081988  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Some 236 women aged 50-59 years with normal\nlevels of cholesterol were participants in the same cohort study in the local\narea. These 236 women had been subdivided into three groups: premenopausal,\npostmenopausal and postmenopausal with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Of the \n48 women in the clinical study group, 12 patients showed pathological ECG\nchanges. Six of these patients were treated with HRT for 2 years (transdermal\nestradiol 50 micrograms/day and a daily dose of 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate,\nMPA) and the rest were non-users of HRT.\nRESULTS: In the women with hypercholesterolemia, 16 of 72 patients (22%) showed\nischemic ECG changes, compared to nine of 88 (10%) with normal cholesterol levels\n(p = 0.04). We found no significant difference in the prevalence of ECG changes\nbetween postmenopausal women with and without HRT in the groups with normal\nlevels of cholesterol. In the hormone treatment group, four of six patients\nshowed an improvement in ECG pattern, in contrast to two of six non-users of HRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study revealed a higher prevalence of pathological \nECG changes in postmenopausal women who had hypercholesterolemia than in\nnormocholesterolemic women. These findings support the idea that hyperlipidemia\ncontributes to the overall increase in cardiovascular disease, as this is also\nassociated with ECG changes. Transdermal estradiol combined with MPA has a\nbeneficial effect in reversing the process of atherosclerosis, as well as\nimproving the ECG pattern. The prevalence of pathological ECG patterns was\nsimilar for HRT users and non-users. This outcome may be affected by several\nfactors. Hence, further research is warranted.\n\nPMID: 11907931  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Box 7057, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and homocysteine (Hcy) are independent\ncardiovascular risk factors, which have been shown to be lowered by hormone\nreplacement therapy (HRT). In this 2-year study, the long-term effects of\nraloxifene (Rlx) in two doses, on Lp(a) and Hcy, were studied and compared with\nthe effects of continuously combined hormone replacement therapy (ccHRT).\nMETHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year\nstudy, 95 healthy, non-hysterectomized, early postmenopausal women, received\ndaily either oral Rlx 60 mg (N=24) or 150 mg (N=23), ccHRT (conjugated equine\nestrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg; N=24) or placebo\n(N=24). Fasting serum Lp(a) and plasma Hcy concentrations were measured at\nbaseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months.\nRESULTS: The mean individual changes compared to baseline after 24 months were\nfor Lp(a): Rlx 60: - 5%, Rlx 150: -7%, ccHRT: -34%, placebo: +1% and for Hcy: Rlx\n60: -3%, Rlx 150: -4%, ccHRT: -4%, placebo: +6%. ANCOVA was significant for Lp(a)\nunder ccHRT versus placebo (P=0.001) and for Lp(a) under ccHRT versus each of the\ntwo Rlx groups (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with Rlx was not as effective as ccHRT in\nlowering Lp(a). Although not significant and without an obvious dose-related\nresponse, the Hcy values showed the same trend for each treatment arm, which is\nin line with data reported earlier.\n\nPMID: 11836041  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\neffect of hormone therapy on these measures depended on the presence (n = 434) or\nabsence (n = 2325) of flushing at study entry. Women with flushing who were\nassigned to hormone therapy had improved mental health (+2.6 vs - 0.5; P =.04)\nand fewer depressive symptoms (-0.5 vs + 0.007; P =.01) over follow-up compared\nwith those assigned to placebo. Women without flushing who were assigned to\nhormone therapy had greater declines in physical function (-4.2 vs -3.3; P =.04) \nand energy/fatigue (-4.6 vs -3.1; P =.03) over follow-up. Quality-of-life scores \nwere significantly lower among patients with older age, diabetes, hypertension,\nchest pain, or heart failure. These differences in quality of life among women\nclassified by clinical characteristics were much greater than the effects of\nhormone therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Hormone therapy has mixed effects on quality of life among older\nwomen. The effects of hormone therapy depend on the presence of menopausal\nsymptoms; women without flushing had greater declines in physical measures, while\nwomen with flushing had improvements in emotional measures of quality of life.\n\nPMID: 11829697  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In a double-blind fashion, subjects were randomized to receive intravenous\nfollowed by oral conjugated estrogen for 21 days, intravenous estrogen followed\nby oral conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone for 21 days or placebo. The \nprimary end point was the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemic\nevents over the first 48 h.

The mean number of ischemic events per patient over 48 h was 0.74 for\nestrogen, 0.86 for estrogen plus progesterone and 0.74 for the placebo groups (p \n= 0.87). The percentage of patients with ischemic events and the mean duration of\nischemia did not differ between hormone- and placebo-treated patients.\nIn-hospital and six-month rates of adverse clinical events were also similar\namong the three randomized groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acute hormone therapy does not reduce ischemia in PMP women with UA \nwhen added to standard anti-ischemic therapy.\n\nPMID: 11788212  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Atherosclerosis. 2002 Jan;160(1):185-93.\n\nA comparison of the effects of two continuous HRT regimens on cardiovascular risk\nfactors.\n\nBarnes JF(1), Farish E, Rankin M, Hart DM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Biochemistry, Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow G21 3UW, Scotland, UK.\n\nIn a study comparing the effects of two continuous HRT regimens on cardiovascular\nrisk markers, 43 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive either\ntibolone 2.5 mg/day (n=20) or 0.625 mg/day conjugated equine oestrogens plus\ncontinuous medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg/day (n=23). Serum lipoprotein levels,\nincluding LDL and HDL subfractions, oxidisability of LDL and serum\nnitrate/nitrite levels were determined before and during 12 weeks of therapy.\nTibolone significantly reduced triglycerides (17.1%, P<0.01), HDL cholesterol\n(22.2%, P<0.001), and the ratio HDL(2)/HDL(3) cholesterol (20.2%, P<0.01). Total \nLDL cholesterol levels did not change significantly, although there was a\ndownward trend in the LDLIII subfraction (12.0% reduction; P=0.06), percentage\nchanges being positively correlated with percentage changes in triglyceride\nlevels (r=0.60, P<0.01). Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was significantly\ndecreased (P<0.001), changes in lag-time being highly negatively correlated with \npercentage changes in levels of both LDLIII (r=-0.68, P<0.01) and triglycerides\n(r=-0.63, P<0.01). Nitrate/nitrite levels did not change. In contrast, the\ncombined therapy caused a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels (11.1%;\nP<0.01) as a result of a significant decrease in the LDLI+II subfraction (12.8%; \nP<0.05). Changes in LDLI+II and LDLIII were correlated with changes in\ntriglyceride levels (r=-0.52, P<0.05 and r=0.63, P<0.01, respectively). No other \nparameter was significantly modified. Between treatment effects were\nsignificantly different on triglycerides (P<0.01), HDL cholesterol (P<0.001), LDL\noxidation (P<0.01) and LDLI+II:LDLIII ratio (P<0.05). The reduction in LDL\ninduced by the continuous combined therapy is likely to be beneficial, despite\nthe apparent shift towards the LDLIII subfraction. Changes in oxidisability and\nsubfraction profile of LDL indicate that tibolone may have a more favourable\neffect on cardiovascular risk than previously suggested.\n\nPMID: 11755937  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Results of a randomized\ncontrolled trial in healthy postmenopausal women.\n\nde Kleijn MJ(1), Wilmink HW, Bots ML, Bak AA, van der Schouw YT, Planellas J,\nEngelen S, Banga JD, Grobbee DE.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Julius Center for General Practice and Patient Oriented Research, University\nMedical Center Utrecht, HP D01.335, PO Box 85500, 3508 GA, Utrecht, The\nNetherlands\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 3 months treatment with tibolone (a single\nentity synthetic steroid hormone with estrogenic, progestanic and androgenic\nactivities), or continuous combined conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), with placebo, on endothelial function.\nDESIGN: A single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\nSETTING: Research center as part of the University Medical Center Utrecht.\nSUBJECTS: One hundred and five healthy postmenopausal women, sampled from the\ngeneral population.\nINTERVENTIONS: Three months treatment with tibolone or CEE+MPA or placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: At baseline and after 3 months, endothelial function was\nassessed non-invasively by measuring percent lumen diameter change in the\nbrachial artery after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerine spray.\nRESULTS: Results are presented as mean differences between treatment groups of\nendothelium dependent flow mediated dilatation (fmd) and endothelium independent \nnitroglycerine induced dilatation with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). After\ntreatment, there was a significant difference in mean fmd between the CEE+MPA\ngroup and the placebo group of 2.5% (95% CI: 0.3-4.6) while the tibolone group\nand the placebo group did not differ significantly (0.6%; 95% CI: 1.6-2.8).\nNitroglycerine induced dilatation did not differ significantly between the\ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy with CEE+MPA for 3 months increases\nendothelium dependent fmd of the brachial artery in healthy postmenopausal women.\nTibolone did not alter fmd. The clinical significance of this improvement in fmd \nfor cardiovascular disease risk needs to be established.\n\nPMID: 11730815  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

At baseline, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, the BP\nwith standard sphygmomanometer and with 24-h ambulatory recording method was\nevaluated in two periods (from day 10 through day 16 of the cycle and from day 20\nthrough day 27 of the cycle). At the same time, we also evaluated total\ncholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides, and fibrinogen levels.\nRESULTS: After 3 and 6 months of treatment, no significant variations of systolic\nand diastolic BP measured with standard sphygmomanometer were detected in both\ngroups. On the contrary, in group A in comparison with basal values and group P, \nand without difference between the two phases of treatment, the 24-h recording\nshowed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in BP. No significant variations were\ndetected in group P versus baseline. In particular, we observed in group A at 3\nmonths of treatment a significant (P<0.05) decrease only in daytime BP in\ncomparison with basal values and group P, without difference between the two\nphases of treatment. Indeed, the decrease in daytime BP was significant (P<0.05) \nfor both systolic and diastolic BP. At 3 and 6 months a significant (P<0.05)\ndecrease in total cholesterol, LDL-c and fibrinogen levels was detected in group \nA versus baseline and group P. HDL-c and triglyceride concentrations showed no\nsignificant variations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The transdermal HRT induces a significant reduction of BP values and\na favorable metabolic action in postmenopausal hypertensive patients.\n\nPMID: 11684376  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Although in hormone replacement schemes progestins are\nrequired to reduce the likelihood of uterine malignancies, little is known on the\ncardiovascular effect of progestins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate\nthe effect of oestrogen replacement alone and two different estrogen-progestin\nreplacement therapy schemes upon exercise induced myocardial ischemia.\nMATERIAL AND METHOD: The study population included 18 female menopausal patients \nwith coronary artery disease. After a baseline exercise test patients received\nconjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.625 mg alone for 30 days when they underwent \na second exercise test and were randomized to receive in a cross-over design\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) either in continuous combined therapy (2.5\nmg/daily) for 28 days or in cyclical therapy (10 mg o.d. from day 16 to day 28).\nRESULTS: After CEE alone two patients with a previously positive exercise test\nshowed a negative exercise test. CEE increased time to 1 mm ST compared to\nbaseline (352+/-185 vs 265+/-133 s, P<0.01). In the 2 pts in whom the exercise\ntest was negative after CEE the test remained negative during continuous combined\nMPA therapy while become positive during cyclical MPA. CEE+continuous combined\nMPA increased both time to 1 mm ST and exercise time compared to baseline\n(386+/-165 vs 265+/-133 s, P<0.01 and 545+/-198 vs 465+/-186 s, P<0.05,\nrespectively). No difference was found between baseline and CEE+cyclical MPA in\neither time to 1 mm ST or exercise time (268+/-164 vs 265+/-133 s, P=NS and\n455+/-223 vs 465+/-186 s, P=NS, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Continuous combined therapy with CEE+MPA improves exercise-induced\nmyocardial ischemia in female patients with coronary artery disease while the\nbeneficial effect of CEE is reduced by cyclical therapy.\n\nPMID: 11574184  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The effects on lipid profile \nand hemostatic parameters were evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12\nmonths of treatment.\nRESULTS: Group I showed a stronger increase of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\ncholesterol levels (2-8%) and stronger reduction of atherogenic indices (total\ncholesterol/HDL cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein/HDL cholesterol) than\ngroup II. Group II showed a more pronounced reduction of triglyceride (21-31%)\nand factor VII (6-10%) levels than group I. Both groups showed reduced\nconcentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tissue \nplasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, antithrombin III, and\nprotein S, whereas protein C was increased after 12 months of treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: The cardioprotective effects of hormone replacement therapy are\ndemonstrated by favorable effects on lipid profile and fibrinolytic activity.\nOral hormone replacement therapy showed a more prominent effect on lipoprotein\nmetabolism than did transdermal administration, but transdermal medication had a \nstronger effect on triglyceride and coagulation factors. However, it needs to be \nconsidered that there is an increased risk of venous thrombotic events in the\nfirst year of treatment.\n\nPMID: 11528361  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\noffers any cardiovascular advantage to diabetic postmenopausal women is not\nknown. Diabetic subjects have increased vascular load and abnormal 24-h blood\npressure (BP) profiles. Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to improve\nindexes of arterial load in nondiabetic postmenopausal women as well as to\nrestore circadian variation in BP. This aim of this study, therefore, was to\ndetermine prospectively whether HRT improved arterial stiffness and 24-h\nambulatory BP profile in diabetic postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: Twelve diabetic postmenopausal women were studied. Six subjects were\nalso hypertensive. Vascular load was characterized by carotid arterial pulse\nwaveform analysis to calculate central augmentation index. All subjects also\nunderwent 24-h BP monitoring. Subjects were studied before commencement of HRT\nand were then randomized to two groups. The first group was observed for 6 months\nand then given 2 months of estrogen alone, followed by 4 months of combination\nestrogen with progestin. The second group received the HRT regimen first, then\nwere restudied after 6 months off HRT.\nRESULTS: The HRT did not affect either clinic or ambulatory BP. There were no\nchanges in indexes of vascular load or pulse pressure, an indirect measure of\narterial stiffness. There was a low rate of circadian variation in 24-h BP at\nbaseline (55%), which was unaltered by HRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HRT was well tolerated. Despite evidence for a beneficial effect\nof HRT on indexes of arterial load and ambulatory BP previously reported in\nnormal subjects, we found no change in this cohort of diabetic postmenopausal\nwomen.\n\nPMID: 11465656  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Three-month short-term HRT in\npostmenopausal women with essential hypertension increased the plasma\nconcentrations ofbradykinin with decreased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) activity, which may be partially responsible for the cardioprotective\neffects of HRT. The objective was to determine whether 12-month long-term HRT in \npostmenopausal women with essential hypertension would maintain the decreased ACE\nactivity and increased bradykinin levels and whether long-term HRT would increase\nthe plasma bradykinin concentrations of normotensive postmenopausal women who had\nshown no significant changes in the 3-month HRT study, despite their decreased\nserum ACE activity.\nDESIGN: Twenty hypertensive and 15 normotensive postmenopausal women were treated\nwith conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day) and medroxyprogesterone (2.5 mg/day) for\n12 months. Twenty hypertensive and 15 normotensive postmenopausal women were used\nas controls. The controls were not treated with HRT. Serum ACE activity and\nplasma bradykinin concentrations were measured at baseline and at 12 months.\nRESULTS: Long-term HRT in both hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women\nsignificantly decreased serum ACE activity from 15.5+/-0.7 IU/L and 16.0+/-0.9\nIU/L, respectively, at baseline to 13.3+/-0.5 IU/L and 14.2+/-0.9 IU/L,\nrespectively, 12 months after the start of HRT (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05,\nrespectively). Long-term HRT in both hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal\nwomen also significantly increased plasma bradykinin concentrations from\n22.1+/-4.4 pg/mL and 19.2+/-3.0 pg/mL, respectively, at baseline to 86.7+/-21.2\npg/mL and 73.5+/-23.0 pg/mL, respectively, 12 months after the start of HRT (p < \n0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). No significant changes in serum ACE activity or\nplasma bradykinin concentrations were observed in the control groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term HRT in hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women \ndecreases their serum ACE activity and increases their plasma bradykinin\nconcentrations. Thus, maintenance of elevated bradykinin with decreased serum ACE\nactivity by HRT may be useful in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in\nboth hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 11355044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In observational studies, the incidence of CHD has been reduced in\npostmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT). A low serum\nlevel of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is one of the risk factors\npredictive of death from CHD.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of HRT on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels \nin elderly women.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING: University research center.\nPARTICIPANTS: 59 sedentary women 75 years of age or older.\nINTERVENTION: Participants were assigned to 9 months of oral therapy with placebo\nor conjugated estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus trimonthly medroxyprogesterone acetate,\n5 mg/d for 13 days.\nMEASUREMENTS: Serum lipid and lipoprotein levels.\nRESULTS: After 9 months of treatment, women in the HRT group compared with women \nin the placebo group had decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels\n(mean change [+/-SD], -0.47 +/- 0.69 mmol/L [-18.2 +/- 26.5 mg/dL] vs. -0.06 +/- \n0.32 mmol/L [-2.2 +/- 12.2 mg/dL], respectively; between-group difference, 0.41\nmmol/L [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.74 mmol/L], 16 mg/dL [95% CI, 3.5 to 28.5 mg/dL]; P =\n0.01) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (mean change, 0.21 +/- 0.27 mmol/L\n[8.1 +/- 10.5 mg/dL] vs. 0.06 +/- 0.11 mmol/L [2.4 +/- 4.3 mg/dL], respectively; \nbetween-group difference, 0.15 mmol/L [CI, 0.008 to 0.29 mmol/L], 5.7 mg/dL [CI, \n0.8 to 10.6 mg/dL]; P = 0.02). The observed changes were independent of age at\nmenopause onset, baseline lipid values, body weight, waist circumference,\npercentage body fat, and peak aerobic power.\nCONCLUSIONS: In women 75 years of age or older, HRT improved the lipoprotein\nprofile to the extent observed previously in younger postmenopausal women.\nFurther studies are needed to evaluate whether these effects protect against CHD \nin this population.\n\nPMID: 11329233  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There are no randomized trial data on the association of\nhormone treatment with knee or hip OA, and no studies have been published\nregarding the relationship of hormone treatment to knee or hip symptoms. This\nstudy examined the association of hormone treatment with prevalent knee symptoms \nand disability related to knee pain as assessed at the final visit of the Heart\nand Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS).\nMETHODS: The HERS was a 4-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\nof estrogen plus medroxy progesterone acetate for prevention of coronary heart\ndisease in postmenopausal women with documented coronary disease. Participants in\nthis substudy on knee pain were 969 postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 66\nyears and mean body mass index of 28.6 kg/m2, attending the final visit at 9\nclinical centers. Frequent knee symptoms were assessed by interview and the\nseverity of knee pain and disability related to knee pain were determined using\nthe Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Knee \nsymptoms and disability were compared between women assigned to receive hormones \nand those assigned to receive placebo.\nRESULTS: Frequent knee pain was reported in 24.1% of women assigned to receive\nhormone therapy versus 26.1% of those assigned to the placebo group, a difference\nof -2.0% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -7.4% to 3.5%). Among women with knee \npain, there were no differences in the severity of pain (score difference -0.2,\n95% CI -1.2 to 0.8) or disability (score difference -0.7, 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4) as \nassessed on the WOMAC. All results were similar for women whose body mass index\nwas either above or below the median.\nCONCLUSION: In a group of older, postmenopausal women with cardiac disease, we\nfound no significant effect of 4 years of estrogen plus progestin therapy\ncompared with placebo on knee pain and related disability. Our findings may not\napply to other groups of women or to the effect of hormone therapy on the\nstructural changes of knee OA.\n\nPMID: 11315920  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

They were randomized at a trial in two \ngroups with pursuit of 6 months. Group A: 53 with captopril, Group B: 53 with\nestradiol-medroxyprogesterone. The arterial pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides \nand symptoms hypoestrogenism were analyzed before and after the treatment. The\nstatistical analysis was performed with Student T.\nRESULTS: A decrease of arterial pressure was observed with estradiol, the same as\nwith captopril with a p < 0.05. Decrease of cholesterol and triglycerides were\nmore significant in the estradiol group with a p < 0.05. A bigger attenuation of \nsymptoms of the hypoestrogenism existed in the estradiol group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The antihypertensive response with estradiol was the same as with\ncaptopril in the premenopausal patient with systemic hypertension.\n\nPMID: 11195960  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There were \nfour randomised treatment phases, each lasting 4 weeks. The four treatments were \nCEE 0.3 mg, CEE 0.625 mg, CEE 1.25 mg and placebo. Each subject also received\nnon-blinded medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg for the final 14 days of each\n28-day treatment cycle. Clinic blood pressure was measured weekly with the mean\nvalues of weeks 3 and 4 of each phase used for analysis. Ambulatory blood\npressure was performed in week 4 of each phase.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo, clinic systolic blood pressure was reduced in the\nCEE 0.3 mg and CEE 0.625 mg phases (p < 0.05) and clinic diastolic blood pressure\nwas reduced in the CEE 0.625 mg phase (p < 0.05). There was no significant effect\nof CEE on ambulatory blood pressure, although the blood pressure pattern was\nsimilar to clinic measurements.\nCONCLUSION: In hypertensive postmenopausal women, daily CEE together with\ncyclical MPA has a variable effect on blood pressure depending on CEE dose. The\n"lower" and "middle" doses of CEE produced a small reduction in blood pressure\nwhich reached a nadir and tended to reverse with the "higher" CEE dose.\n\nPMID: 11193131  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We\ncompare costs, yields, and participant characteristics between community-based\nand hospital-based recruitment strategies. We further compare community-based\nenriched sources (i.e., those that allowed self-selection or targeted women with \nknown health characteristics) and nonenriched sources. Data gathered on potential\nparticipants include method of contact, clinical site, eligibility, completion of\nscreening visits, and randomization rates. Demographic data on participants\ninclude age, race, education, marital status, and income. Self-reported health\nstatus, smoking status, lipid level, ejection fraction as well as history of\nchest pain, hypertension, and diabetes were recorded at baseline. Recruitment\ncosts were estimated from employee salaries and costs of screening tests and\nprocedures. Yields were compared by clinical site and by method of contact.\nEnriched sources of recruitment yielded higher percentages of enrolled\nparticipants than nonenriched sources. Both types of source resulted in\ndemographically similar participants. Costs of community-based recruitment were\nless than hospital-based recruitment; however, screening costs were higher.\nOverall, screening and recruitment averaged $2508 per randomized participant.\nControl Clin Trials 2001;22:13-25\n\nPMID: 11165419  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The effects of combination\nestrogen/progestin therapy on myocardial ischemia are unknown.\nMETHODS: Eighteen postmenopausal women (mean +/- SD age 59+/-7 years) were given \n17-beta-estradiol in single-blinded manner for four weeks (1 mg/day for three\nweeks then 2 mg/day for one week). Estradiol (2 mg/day) was then continued, and\nthe patients were randomized (double-blind) for 12 days to either transvaginal\nprogesterone gel (90 mg on alternate days) and oral MPA placebo (10 mg/day), or\nvice versa. After another two weeks on estradiol alone, the patients crossed over\nto progestin treatment and repeated the protocol on the opposite treatment.\nPatients underwent treadmill exercise testing after each estradiol phase and at\nday 10 of each progestin phase.\nRESULTS: Exercise time to myocardial ischemia increased after the first estrogen \nphase as compared with baseline (mean difference with 95% confidence interval\n[CI]: 72 s [34 to 110], p = 0.001), and was increased by combination\nestradiol/progesterone therapy as compared with estradiol/MPA therapy (92 s [35\nto 149], p = 0.001)). Two patients (11%) were withdrawn while taking\nestradiol/MPA owing to unstable angina.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combination estrogen/transvaginal progesterone gel increases\nexercise time to myocardial ischemia, as compared with estrogen/MPA. These\nresults imply that the choice of progestin in women at higher cardiovascular risk\nrequires careful consideration.\n\nPMID: 11127455  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The impact of estrogen on atherosclerotic disease \nin other peripheral arteries is unknown.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (CHD) and\nan intact uterus (n=2763) were randomly assigned to conjugated equine estrogens\n(0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) daily or to placebo\nin a secondary CHD prevention trial. This analysis focuses on incident peripheral\narterial procedures and deaths in the 2 treatment groups; peripheral vascular\ndisease was a predefined secondary outcome. During a mean of 4.1 years of\nfollow-up, 311 peripheral arterial events were reported in 213 women, an annual\nincidence of 2.9%. The number of women who had peripheral arterial events was 99 \namong those assigned to active estrogen/progestin and 114 among those assigned to\nplacebo, a nonsignificant difference (relative hazard 0. 87, 95% CI 0.66 to\n1.14). In the placebo group, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were\nindependently associated with higher rates of peripheral arterial events, and\nplasma HDL cholesterol and body mass index were associated with lower rates of\nperipheral arterial events. In the estrogen/progestin group, current smoking and \ndiabetes were independent predictors of peripheral arterial events. Incident\nperipheral arterial disease was not a significant predictor of coronary,\ncardiovascular, or total mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment with oral conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone\nacetate was not associated with a significant reduction in incident peripheral\narterial events in postmenopausal women with preexisting CHD.\n\nPMID: 11056097  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

To\nunderstand better the role of estrogen in the treatment and prevention of heart\ndisease, more information is needed about its effects on coronary atherosclerosis\nand the extent to which concomitant progestin therapy may modify these effects.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 309 women with angiographically verified\ncoronary disease to receive 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen per day, 0.625 mg of \nconjugated estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate per day, or\nplacebo. The women were followed for a mean (+/-SD) of 3.2+/-0.6 years. Base-line\nand follow-up coronary angiograms were analyzed by quantitative coronary\nangiography.\nRESULTS: Estrogen and estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate produced\nsignificant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (9.4 percent\nand 16.5 percent, respectively) and significant increases in high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol levels (18.8 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively);\nhowever, neither treatment altered the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\nAfter adjustment for measurements at base line, the mean (+/-SE) minimal\ncoronary-artery diameters at follow-up were 1.87+/-0.02 mm, 1.84+/-0.02 mm, and\n1.87+/-0.02 mm in women assigned to estrogen, estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone\nacetate, and placebo, respectively. The differences between the values for the\ntwo active-treatment groups and the value for the placebo group were not\nsignificant. Analyses of several secondary angiographic outcomes and subgroups of\nwomen produced similar results. The rates of clinical cardiovascular events were \nalso similar among the treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Neither estrogen alone nor estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate\naffected the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in women with established\ndisease. These results suggest that such women should not use estrogen\nreplacement with an expectation of cardiovascular benefit.\n\nPMID: 10954759  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We compared simvastatin (20 mg daily) with hormone replacement\ntherapy (0.625 mg conjugated oestrogen and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate\ndaily) and their combination, in a randomized, crossover, placebo controlled\nstudy. Each treatment period was 8 weeks long with a 4 week washout interval\nbetween treatments. Circulating cell adhesion molecules and plasma lipids were\nevaluated at the end of each treatment period.\nRESULTS: All three active treatments--simvastatin, hormone replacement therapy\nand the combination therapy--significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol,\ncompared to placebo (P<0.001). Only hormone replacement therapy, alone and in\ncombination with simvastatin, significantly decreased lipoprotein(a) when\ncompared to placebo (P<0.05), whereas simvastatin had no significant effect.\nLikewise, hormone replacement therapy and the combination therapy significantly\nreduced the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) plasma levels (P=0.03 and\nP=0.02, respectively), while simvastatin, which was superior to hormone\nreplacement therapy in lowering total and LDL cholesterol, did not modify ICAM-1 \nlevels; the combination therapy was not more effective than hormone replacement\ntherapy alone in ICAM-1 reduction. Neither the effect, on any treatment when\ncompared to placebo, of VCAM-1 nor E-selectin levels differed significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy may limit the inflammatory response to\ninjury by modulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules from the\nendothelial cells, possibly in association with lipoprotein (a) reduction.\n\nPMID: 10901509  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A significant\nreduction in the levels of von Willebrand factor in the HRT-group compared to\ncontrols was seen after 3 months, maintained after 12 months (p <0.001).\nSignificant reduction in the HRT-group compared to controls was also seen in\nVCAM-1 after 3 months, sustained after 12 months (p = 0.013 and p = 0.045,\nrespectively), and E-selectin was reduced by about 20% after 3 months on HRT, the\nreduction being statistically significant after 12 months (p <0.001).\nSignificantly reduced levels of ICAM-1 were also seen after 12 months (p =\n0.048). No effects could be observed on tPA-antigen or thrombomodulin. The\nreduction in procoagulant and proinflammatory markers of endothelial function\nafter long-term transdermal HRT could indicate a beneficial effect on the\nendothelium and thus a potentially modulating effect on the progression of\natherosclerosis in women with CAD.\n\nPMID: 10896253  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A total of 309\npostmenopausal women at five sites underwent baseline coronary angiography and\nwere randomized. Participants will have repeat coronary angiography after an\naverage of 3.25 years of treatment. The primary outcome of interest will be\nchange in minimum diameter of the major epicardial segments, as assessed by\nquantitative coronary angiography. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that\neither form of hormone therapy will slow the progression or induce regression of \ncoronary atherosclerosis compared to placebo. The secondary aims are to assess\nthe effects of the two treatments versus placebo on endothelial function\n(measured using flow-mediated vasodilator responses), on several presumed\nmediators of estrogen's effect on atherosclerosis (i.e., plasma lipids and\nlipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, hemostatic factors, and\nantioxidant activity), on other factors that influence the development of\ncoronary heart disease (i.e., diet, smoking status, exercise, weight, and\nhealth-related quality of life issues), and on clinical cardiovascular events.\nThe ERA trial is the first angiographic endpoint clinical trial to examine the\neffects of postmenopausal hormone replacement on coronary atherosclerosis in\nwomen. It will provide an unparalleled opportunity to determine if either regimen\nof hormone therapy is effective in slowing the progress of angiographically\ndefined coronary atherosclerosis. This study will complement other estrogen\nreplacement trials, such as the PEPI, HERS, and Women's Health Initiative\nstudies, to provide a more comprehensive examination of the effects of estrogen\nreplacement on cardiovascular risk factors, anatomic and functional\nmanifestations of atherosclerosis, and risk for coronary heart disease in\npostmenopausal women.

All analyses were performed examiner-blind.\nSUBJECTS: Postmenopausal women (n = 118) with angiographically verified coronary \nartery disease were recruited consecutively from patients referred for\ninvestigational procedures due to coronary artery disease.\nINTERVENTIONS: The women were randomized to HRT, i.e. transdermal application of \ncontinuous 17-beta oestradiol with cyclic medroxyprogesterone actetate tablets\nevery 3rd month for 14 days, or to a control group.\nMAIN OUTCOMES: Effects on lipids and lipoproteins.\nRESULTS: After 3 months of unopposed oestradiol, triglycerides decreased\nsignificantly compared to the control group (P = 0.006). Sequential\nadministration of medroxyprogesterone caused a decrease in HDL cholesterol (P =\n0.01), concomitantly with a decrease in ApoA1 lipoproteins (P = 0.007). No other \nchanges in lipids or lipoproteins were observed. After 12 months of therapy, no\nsignificant differences were observed between the two groups in lipid or\nlipoprotein levels. Concomitant statin treatment did not alter the main findings.\nCONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with established coronary artery disease in \nwhom the majority is treated with statins, no additional effect of HRT on lipids \nor lipoproteins could be observed except for a transient decrease in\ntriglycerides in the initial unopposed oestradiol phase. No deleterious effect\ncould be observed during medroxyprogesterone administration except for a small\ntransient decrease in HDL cholesterol and ApoA1 lipoproteins.\n\nPMID: 10792556  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After multivariate adjustment, women in\nthe second, third, and fourth quartiles of baseline Lp(a) level had relative\nhazards (RHs) (compared with the first quartile) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval\n[CI], 0.64-1.59), 1.31 (95% CI, 0.85-2.04), and 1.54 (95% CI, 0.99-2.39),\nrespectively, compared with women in the lowest quartile (P for trend = .03).\nTreatment with estrogen and progestin reduced mean (SD) Lp(a) levels\nsignificantly (-5.8 [15] mg/dL) (-0.20 [0.53] micromol/L) compared with placebo\n(0.3 [17] mg/dL) (0.01 [0.60] micromol/L) (P<.001). In a randomized subgroup\ncomparison, women with low baseline Lp(a) levels had less benefit from estrogen\nand progestin than women with high Lp(a) levels; the RH for women assigned to\nestrogen and progestin compared with placebo were 1.49 (95% CI, 0.97-2.26) in the\nlowest quartile and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.67-1.65), 0.78 (0.52-1.18), and 0.85\n(0.58-1.25) in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively (P for\ninteraction trend = .03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for\nrecurrent CHD in postmenopausal women and that treatment with estrogen and\nprogestin lowers Lp(a) levels. Estrogen and progestin therapy appears to have a\nmore favorable effect (relative to placebo) in women with high initial Lp(a)\nlevels than in women with low levels. This apparent interaction needs\nconfirmation in other trials.\n\nPMID: 10770146  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients receiving insulin were excluded from the study and all lipid\nmodifying drugs were ceased at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation. Other\nmedication including oral hypoglycaemics was kept constant for the duration of\nthe study.\nRESULTS: Women with type II diabetes were a similar age (58.7+/-1.3 years) to the\nnon-diabetic women (59.6+/-1.6 years) but they had a significantly greater body\nmass index, a higher incidence of treated hypertension, higher fasting plasma\nglucose levels, higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol levels than\nnon-diabetic women. ERT reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by a\nsimilar extent (8.9-12.3%) in normal and type II diabetic women and increased HDL\ncholesterol to a similar extent in both groups (11.0 and 8.9% respectively). ERT \ndid not significantly alter fasting triglyceride levels in either group. The\naddition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg daily abolished the increase in HDL \ncholesterol associated with ERT in both groups but did not significantly affect\nany of the other lipid measurements. ERT and HRT did not significantly alter\nfasting insulin levels nor alter fasting glucose levels in either non-diabetic\nwomen or women with type II diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS: ERT and HRT have similar effects on lipids in women with type II\ndiabetes and non-diabetic women after 1 month of therapy.\n\nPMID: 10717490  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Abdelonoor, M [corrected to Abdelnoor, M].\n    J Intern Med 2001 Jan;249(1):1. Abdelonoor, M [corrected to Abdelnoor, M].\n\nOBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women \nmay reduce the cardiovascular risk. A dominant protective role of transforming\ngrowth factor beta (TGF-beta1) on coronary arteries has been proposed. Lp(a)\nlipoprotein may block the activation of latent TGF-beta1. Given this background, \nwe examined the effects of HRT on TGF-beta1 and Lp(a) lipoprotein in 99\npostmenopausal women. The women had angiographically documented coronary heart\ndisease (CHD) and were randomized to either sequential transdermal\n17beta-oestradiol for 14 weeks and then medroxyprogesterone (MPA) for 14 days\n(HRT) or to a control group (C).\nRESULTS: Serum levels of TGF-beta1 were increased in the HRT group compared with \nthe C group after 3 months' treatment and this effect was sustained after 12\nmonths. There was a significant reduction in Lp(a) lipoprotein serum levels after\n3 months' treatment in the HRT group compared with the C group. However, after 12\nmonths, no significant difference in changes in Lp(a) lipoprotein serum levels\nwas detected between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: The novel observation that transdermal 17beta-oestradiol in\npostmenopausal women increases levels of TGF-beta1 and lowers the concentration\nof Lp(a) lipoprotein suggests yet another possible mechanism for the\ncardioprotective effect of HRT. Whereas combination therapy of oestradiol and MPA\npreserves the beneficial effect on TGF-beta1, it reduces the unopposed oestradiol\neffects on Lp(a) lipoprotein.\n\nPMID: 10692092  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Of the 2763 women enrolled, \n1380 were randomised to receive 0.625mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5mg\nof medroxyprogesterone daily (Prempro) and 1383 were randomised to receive a\nplacebo. The results were surprising: 179 women in the hormone group and 182\nwomen in the placebo group experienced either a nonfatal myocardial infarction or\nCHD death (relative hazard 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.22). This\noccurred despite a net 11% reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) and a net\n10% increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) after 1 year of follow-up (p <\n0.001 for LDL and HDL). Also, there were no differences between the 2 treatment\ngroups in any secondary cardiovascular outcomes. The overall null effect may have\nbeen the result of an unexpected early adverse effect of the HRT regimen that\noffset a later reduction in risk. Clearly, the use of HRT for secondary\nprevention of heart disease is more complex than was initially believed. More\ndata are needed from other clinical trials concerning the risks and benefits of\nHRT to confirm or refute the puzzling HERS results. HERS also underscores the\nneed for trials with clinical end-points to evaluate both the safety and efficacy\nof drug therapy. Although observational studies are useful, they cannot provide\ndefinitive answers regarding treatment recommendations. Until further data are\navailable, clinicians should not use estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone for the\nsole purpose of secondary prevention of CHD.\n\nPMID: 10641952  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Estrogen and estrogen/progestin replacement therapy\nhave been suggested to lower plasma homocysteine levels in postmenopausal women. \nTo assess the impact of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on plasma homocysteine,\nlevels were measured in samples from adherent women randomized to placebo (n =\n34), conjugated equine estrogens (n = 36), or continuous conjugated equine\nestrogens + progestin (n = 33) in the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin\nInterventions (PEPI) Trial. Homocysteine levels decreased between baseline and\nfollow-up (12 and 36 months) in all treatment groups. The magnitude of the\nreduction was greater in the conjugated estrogens group at 12 months compared\nwith placebo (p = 0.036), even when adjusted for folate and B vitamin\nconsumption, but this difference did not persist at 36 months. These data suggest\nthat estrogen therapy has a modest, but transient, impact on plasma homocysteine \nlevels in women with normal homocysteine at baseline.\n\nPMID: 10595329  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

HRT consisted of 2 months of conjugated\nequine estrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg daily, followed by 4 months CEE and\nmedroxyprogesterone 5 mg daily. Measures included anthropometry, fasting glucose,\ninsulin, HbA1c, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, LDL\nparticle size, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), sex hormone-binding globulin,\nresting energy expenditure (REE), total and central abdominal fat (by dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry), resting BP, APWV (by applanation tonometry), physical\nactivity, well-being, and sexual function.\nRESULTS: Six months of HRT resulted in significant reductions in waist-to-hip\nratio (-0.03+/-0.01 vs. 0.01+/-0.009, P = 0.007), HbA1c (-0.34+/-0.24 vs.\n0.6+/-0.4%, P = 0.04), total cholesterol (-0.6+/-0.1 vs. 0.2+/-0.2 mmol/l, P =\n0.001), central abdominal fat (-175+/-51 vs. -24+/-56 g, P = 0.05), and improved \nphysical functioning (P = 0.05), compared with observation. There was a minor\nincrease in REE with HRT (33+/-23 vs. -38+/-23 kJ/day, P = 0.04). Total fat mass,\nfasting glucose, insulin, triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, NEFA, resting BP, APWV,\nand physical activity were unchanged.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal HRT in these overweight women with type 2 diabetes\nwas associated with a reduction in central adiposity and improvement in lipid\nmetabolism and glycemic control without deterioration in weight status or\ncardiovascular parameters measured. Whether HRT-induced improvements in these\ncardiovascular risk factors result in lower long-term cardiovascular morbidity\nand mortality, as observed in nondiabetic women, awaits further study.\n\nPMID: 10480500  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In contrast, in a recent clinical trial \nof women with coronary disease, a subgroup analysis demonstrated increased risk\nduring the early months of therapy. Because higher levels of inflammation factors\npredict vascular disease outcomes, the effect of hormones on these factors is of \ninterest.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Four inflammation-sensitive factors, C-reactive protein,\nsoluble E-selectin, von Willebrand factor antigen, and coagulation factor VIIIc\nwere measured at baseline, 12, and 36 months in 365 participants of the\nPostmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) Trial, a randomized,\nplacebo-controlled trial of the effects of 4 hormone preparations on\ncardiovascular disease risk factors. Compared with placebo, all 4 active\npreparations resulted in a large sustained increase in the concentration of\nC-reactive protein and a decrease in soluble E-selectin (P=0.0001). There were no\neffects of treatment on concentrations of von Willebrand factor or factor VIIIc. \nThere were no differences in effects among treatment arms. Relative to placebo,\nwhen combining active treatment arms, final concentrations of C-reactive protein \nwere 85% higher whereas E-selectin was 18% lower compared with baseline.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal hormones rapidly increased the concentration of the\ninflammation factor C-reactive protein. Such an effect may be related to adverse \nearly effects of estrogen therapy. In contrast, hormones reduced the\nconcentration of soluble E-selectin, and this might be considered an\nanti-inflammatory effect. Because PEPI was not designed to assess clinical\nendpoints, studies of the impact of hormone-mediated changes in inflammation on\nrisk of subsequent coronary events are needed.\n\nPMID: 10449693  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Lovastatin was\nmore effective than estrogen/progestin in reducing LDL (p < 0.001), but\nestrogen/progestin was slightly more effective in increasing HDL. The hormone\nreplacement and lovastatin regimen blocked the estrogen-associated increase in\ntriglycerides. Hormone replacement (alone and with lovastatin) resulted in\nincreases in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilator capacity (p = 0.01 for\nboth regimens) and the area under the curve (p = 0.016 and p = 0.005,\nrespectively) compared with baseline. Percent dilation was greatest after the\nhormone replacement regimen, whereas the area under the curve was greatest after \nhormone replacement plus lovastatin (69% improvement vs. baseline).\nCONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with coronary disease and hyperlipidemia,\nconjugated equine estrogen produced significant improvements in lipids and\nvasodilator responses despite the concurrent administration of low dose\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate. Low dose lovastatin produced greater reductions in\nLDL, but less dramatic improvements in vasodilator responses. Estrogen/progestin \nplus lovastatin may provide additional benefits via a greater reduction in the\nLDL/HDL ratio and attenuation of estrogen-associated hypertriglyceridemia. More\ninformation is needed about the safety and efficacy of such combinations of\nhormone replacement and reductase inhibitor therapy.\n\nPMID: 10362210  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Plasma viscosity is an important predictor of incident and recurrent\ncardiovascular events and mortality in coronary heart disease patients. The\neffect of estrogen alone or in combination with progestin on plasma viscosity is \nnot known. Using a randomized, double-blind design, we examined the impact of the\nfollowing daily hormone regimens on plasma viscosity in 23 women: (1) 1 mg\nestradiol and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone (n=7); (2) 1 mg estradiol alone (n=8);\nand (3) placebo (n=8). Plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, and standard lipoprotein\nlevels were determined at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. Plasma\nviscosity was measured at 37 degreesC with a coaxial microviscometer. Fibrinogen \nwas measured by the Clauss method. Significant changes in plasma viscosity\n(mPa.s) levels occurred among treatment groups (P<0.01) after the intervention.\nPlasma viscosity was significantly reduced with estrogen replacement therapy\n(P<0.01). These data demonstrate that estrogen replacement therapy lowers plasma \nviscosity. This study suggests an additional mechanism for the cardiovascular\nprotection conferred to postmenopausal women on estrogen replacement therapy.\n\nPMID: 9848882  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In postmenopausal women HRT seems to increase survival,\nparticularly those with ischemic heart disease, and this is partly due to changes\nin lipid levels.\nMETHODS: We studied 16 postmenopausal women with CAD and fasting total\ncholesterol <200 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <130 mg/dl. \nWe compared HRT (0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen and 2.5 mg of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate daily) with simvastatin (20 mg daily) and their\ncombination in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study. Each treatment \nperiod was 8 weeks long with a 4-week washout interval between treatments.\nRESULTS: Simvastatin, HRT and their combination significantly reduced total and\nLDL cholesterol by 35%, 13%, and 33% and 45%, 20%, and 46%, respectively,\ncompared to placebo (p < 0.001). However, simvastatin and the combination was\nsuperior to HRT (p < 0.001), and none of our patients had total cholesterol <180 \nmg/dl and LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl on HRT alone. High-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol was not significantly affected by any of the active treatments, and\ntriglycerides were lower during simvastatin therapy compared to placebo (p <\n0.01). Apolipoprotein B was significantly reduced by simvastatin, alone and\ncombined with HRT, by 39% and 35%, respectively, compared to placebo (p < 0.001).\nAlone and in combination with simvastatin, HRT significantly increased\napolipoprotein A-I by 11% and 12%, respectively, compared to placebo (p < 0.05)\nand decreased lipoprotein (a) by 23% and 33%, respectively, compared to placebo\n(p < 0.05), whereas simvastatin had no significant effect on either of these\nparameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: In hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women with CAD, HRT exerts\nbeneficial effects on plasma lipids but the levels currently recommended for\nsecondary prevention are not achieved. Hormone replacement therapy combined with \nsimvastatin is well tolerated and extremely effective, as the two therapies seem \nto be additive.\n\nPMID: 9809932  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Mean age was 66.7 years.\nINTERVENTION: Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of\nidentical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those\nassigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the\nend of 3 years.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal\nmyocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes\nincluded coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure,\nresuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral \narterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\nRESULTS: Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the\nprimary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in \nthe hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death\n(relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack\nof an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in\nthe hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the\noverall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more \nCHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in \nyears 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group\nexperienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) \nand gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no\nsignificant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, \nincluding fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95%\nCI, 0.84-1.38).\nCONCLUSIONS: During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral\nconjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the\noverall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary\ndisease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and\ngallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit\nand a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend\nstarting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, \ngiven the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it\ncould be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.\n\nPMID: 9718051  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Control Clin Trials. 1998 Aug;19(4):314-35.\n\nHeart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS): design, methods, and\nbaseline characteristics.\n\nGrady D(1), Applegate W, Bush T, Furberg C, Riggs B, Hulley SB.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San\nFrancisco, 94105, USA.\n\nThe Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) is a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the efficacy and safety\nof estrogen plus progestin therapy for prevention of recurrent coronary heart\ndisease (CHD) events in women. The participants are postmenopausal women with a\nuterus and with CHD as evidenced by prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery \nbypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or other\nmechanical revascularization or at least 50% occlusion of a major coronary\nartery. Between February 1993 and September 1994, 20 HERS centers recruited and\nrandomized 2763 women. Participants ranged in age from 44 to 79 years, with a\nmean age of 66.7 (SD 6.7) years. Most participants were white (89%), married\n(57%), and had completed high school or some college (80%). As expected, the\nprevalence of coronary risk factors was high: 62% were past or current smokers,\n59% had hypertension, 90% had serum LDL-cholesterol of 100 mg/dL or higher, and\n23% had diabetes. Each woman was randomly assigned to receive one tablet\ncontaining 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate \ndaily or an identical placebo. Participants will be evaluated every 4 months for \nan average of 4.2 years for the occurrence of CHD events (CHD death and nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction). We will also assess other major CHD endpoints, including \nrevascularization and hospitalization for unstable angina. The primary analysis\nwill compare the rate of CHD events in women assigned to active treatment with\nthe rate in those assigned to placebo. The trial was designed to have power\ngreater than 90% to detect a 35% reduction in the incidence of CHD events,\nassuming a 50% lag in effect for 2 years and a 5% annual event rate in the\nplacebo group. The design, analysis, and conduct of the study are controlled by\nthe Steering Committee of Principal Investigators and coordinated at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco. HERS is the largest trial of any\nintervention to reduce the risk of recurrent CHD events in women with heart\ndisease and is the first controlled trial to seek evidence of the efficacy and\nsafety of postmenopausal hormone therapy to prevent recurrent CHD events.\n\nPMID: 9683309  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Both dosages of\nraloxifene significantly lowered lipoprotein(a) by 7% to 8% (P < .001), less than\nthe 19% decrease with HRT (P<.001). Raloxifene increased high-density\nlipoprotein-2 cholesterol (HDL2-C) by 15% to 17% (P < .05), less than the 33%\nincrease with HRT (P < .001). Raloxifene did not significantly change\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, or plasminogen\nactivator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1); whereas HRT increased HDL-C by 11% and\ntriglycerides by 20%, and decreased PAI-1 by 29% (for all, P < .001). Raloxifene \nsignificantly lowered fibrinogen by 12% to 14% (P < .001), unlike HRT, which had \nno effect. Neither treatment changed fibrinopeptide A or prothrombin fragment 1\nand 2.\nCONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene favorably alters biochemical markers of cardiovascular\nrisk by decreasing LDL-C, fibrinogen, and lipoprotein(a), and by increasing\nHDL2-C without raising triglycerides. In contrast to HRT, raloxifene had no\neffect on HDL-C and PAI-1, and a lesser effect on HDL2-C and lipoprotein(a).\nFurther clinical trials are necessary to determine whether these favorable\nbiochemical effects are associated with protection against cardiovascular\ndisease.\n\nPMID: 9600478  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Clinical evaluations \nwere performed at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigations included\ngynecological history. occurrence of climacteric symptoms, quality of life\nevaluation, cardiac history and symptoms of angina pectoris.\nRESULTS: Forty-six women (77%) completed the study during 1 year. The following\ncardiac events occurred in the women who completed the study: one patient was\nhospitalized because of congestive heart failure (patch), two patients because of\nangina pectoris, one patient because of coronary bypass operation (CEE) and three\npatients underwent balloon dilatation (placebo), all three on CEE. Among the 14\nwomen who discontinued, two patients had TIA (patch), one experienced\npalpitations (CEE) and one woman died from myocardial infarction (placebo).\nOverall improvement in mood and cognitive functions were reported in all three\ntreatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: HRT does not seem to have negative effects on symptoms of angina\npectoris and seems to increase quality of life in older women with coronary heart\ndisease. It also seems safe from the cardiovascular point of view.\n\nPMID: 9571599  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions.\n\nEspeland MA(1), Marcovina SM, Miller V, Wood PD, Wasilauskas C, Sherwin R,\nSchrott H, Bush TL.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Section on Biostatistics, Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest\nUniversity, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1063, USA. mespelan@rc.phs.bgsm.edu\n\nBACKGROUND: Postmenopausal hormone therapy has been reported to decrease levels\nof lipoprotein (Lp)(a) in cross-sectional studies and small or short-term\nlongitudinal studies. We report findings from a large, prospective,\nplacebo-controlled clinical trial that allows a broad characterization of these\neffects for four regimens of hormone therapy.\nMETHODS AND RESULT: The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions study was\na 3-year, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of\nhormone regimens on cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women\n45 to 65 years of age. The active regimens were conjugated equine estrogens\ntherapy at 0.625 mg daily, alone or in combination with each of three regimens of\nprogestational agents: medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) at 2.5 mg daily (ie,\ncontinuous MPA), MPA at 10 mg days 1 to 12 (ie, cyclical MPA), and micronized\nprogesterone at 200 mg days 1 to 12. Plasma levels of Lp(a) were measured at\nbaseline (n = 366), 12 months (n = 354), and 36 months (n = 342). Assignment to\nhormone therapy resulted in a 17% to 23% average drop in Lp(a) concentrations\nrelative to placebo (P<.0001), which was maintained across 3 years of follow-up. \nNo significant differences were observed among the four active arms. Changes in\nLp(a) associated with hormone therapy were positively correlated with changes in \nLDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and fibrinogen levels and\nwere similar across subgroups defined by age, weight, ethnicity, and prior\nhormone use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal estrogen therapy, with or without concomitant\nprogestin regimens, produces consistent and sustained reductions in plasma Lp(a) \nconcentrations.\n\nPMID: 9529266  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Low-density cholesterol decreased with EV/CPA \nwhile it increased with CE/MPA. High-density cholesterol remained fairly\nunchanged, and triglycerides increased significantly in both groups. Estradiol\nand estrone levels increased significantly more with EV/CPA than with CE/MPA\nwhile the sex-hormone-binding globulin increased more with CE/MPA. Follicle\nstimulating and luteinizing hormone levels also decreased significantly. Total\ntestosterone and dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate remained stable. Total\nlevothyroxine serum levels increased significantly, but thyroid stimulating\nhormone and triiodothyronine levels remained stable. Coagulation parameters also \nremained stable. Angiotensinogen increased, while plasma renin activity and blood\npressure remained unchanged.\nCONCLUSION: It is concluded that both EV/CPA and CE/MPA produce favourable\nmetabolic effects. A better lipid profile, compatible with decreased\ncardiovascular risk, is observed with the EV/CPA regimen. Higher circulating\nestrogen levels may explain in part this observation.\n\nPMID: 9288700  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Blood samples \nwere taken before and at 6 and 12 months of HRT. Concentrations of serum total,\nlow density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol\ndecreased by 14% (P < .001), 17% (P < .001), and 9% (P < .001) in the oral HRT\ngroup. Respective changes were 5.7% (P < .001), 4.8% (P < .05), and 4.7% (NS) in \nthe transdermal group. Serum triglycerides remained unchanged in the oral group\nbut decreased by 15.7% (P < .001) in the transdermal group. We observed only\ntrivial changes in serum apo B levels. The changes in apo A-I levels paralleled\nthose of HDL cholesterol in the oral HRT group. The concentration of serum Lp(a) \ndecreased by 31% (P < .001) and 16% (P < .001) in the two groups. The combination\nof progestin and transdermal estrogen was not associated with any further change \nof Lp(a). The decrement in Lp(a) during therapy was positively associated with\nbaseline Lp(a) levels in both groups (r = .96, P < .001 and r = .88, P < .001).\nThus, both HRT regimens were highly effective in lowering elevated Lp(a) levels\nin postmenopausal women. The divergent responses of LDL and HDL cholesterol in\nthe two HRT groups may influence the potential cardioprotective effects of the\ntwo HRT regimens. Prospective trials are needed to define the long-term effects\nwith respect to coronary heart disease risk.\n\nPMID: 8857916  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Eur Heart J. 1996 Aug;17 Suppl D:9-14.\n\nEvidence for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in women\ntaking oestrogen replacement therapy.\n\nBush TL.\n\nAuthor information: \nJHU Womens Research Core, Lutherville, MD, USA.\n\nThe increasing use of oestrogen replacement therapy in women has focussed\nattention on the cardioprotective properties it has demonstrated. Historically,\nit has been shown that women enjoy a certain protection from heart disease, a\nphenomenon, however, which has not been studied extensively. Women at every age\nhave less coronary artery disease (CAD) than men, even when various risk factors \nare accounted for, although the presence of diabetes carries equal mortality for \nboth sexes. However, women who do develop CAD have a greater risk of mortality\nthan men with CAD. Other gender differences include a later age of onset of CAD\nfor women, and a difference in the type of atherosclerotic lesions developed.\nMost striking is the fact that, in women, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) seems to\nbe a more potent predictor of major cardiovascular events than low-density\nlipoprotein (LDL), or total cholesterol. The Postmenopausal Oestrogen and\nProgesterone Interventions (PEPI) Trial looked at changes in HDL, fibrinogen,\nblood pressure and serum insulin resulting from oestrogen use. Four regimens were\ncompared against placebo in 875 women. The results showed that HDL was increased \nsignificantly, LDL decreased significantly, fibrinogen levels decreased\nsignificantly, and blood pressure and serum insulin levels were essentially\nunaffected by oestrogen and oestrogen/progestin interactions. The Heart and\nOestrogen/Progestin Replacement (HERS) Study, currently underway, is a secondary \nprevention trial testing the protective effect of hormone therapy in women with\ndocumented CAD. This trial may definitively answer the question of whether\nhormones protect against CAD. After HERS, it may be unethical to continue\nconducting placebo-controlled trials in a therapy that has such documented\ncardioprotective benefit.\n\nPMID: 8869876  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The tissue factor activity in monocytes was\nmeasured both in unstimulated whole blood and after a weak lipopolysaccharide\nstimulation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and thromboxane B2 formation in plasma\nwere measured after a weak lipopolysaccharide stimulation of whole blood.\nRESULTS: After 12 months of hormone replacement therapy there were significant\nreductions of tissue factor activity in both unstimulated and\nlipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes (p < 0.001) and significant reductions in\nthe formation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (p < 0.03) and thromboxane B2 (p <\n0.02). There were no differences in these parameters between the transdermal and \nthe oral groups. No changes were observed after 3 months of therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve months of hormone replacement therapy reduces cellular\nactivation of blood monocytes and platelets; these changes may account for some\nof the beneficial effects in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nPMID: 8610768  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In this\nstudy, epirubicin (EpiADM) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were given to\nadvanced prostatic cancer patients with symptomatic bone involvement who had\nprogressed to hormonal therapy. EpiADM was administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2\ni.v. weekly and MPA at a daily dose of 1,000 mg p.o. for the first month and 500 \nmg thereafter. Fifty-four patients entered the trial, all of whom were evaluable.\nAmelioration of pain and a > or = 50% reduction in analgesic intake were observed\nin 52% of cases, with a mean duration of 4 months. Of the 28 responsive patients,\n26 had already received two lines of hormonal therapy or were resistant to\nfirst-line therapy. Of the 23 patients with measurable lesions, 6 obtained a > or\n= 50% tumor shrinkage at these sites. The treatment was well tolerated, and no\ncardiac toxicity was observed up to a total cumulative EpiADM dose of 660 mg/m2. \nIn conclusion, this regimen seems to have a palliative effect in patients with\nadvanced prostatic cancer who have progressed to hormonal therapy, and it is\nfeasible in an outpatient setting.\n\nPMID: 7538260  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

First, the effect of\nlow-dose estrogen was studied in a group of 83 postmenopausal women who were\ntreated with 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens (CE). No significant change from\nbaseline levels was found at the end of cycle 3 and cycle 13. Secondly, in 15\nmothers and 23 daughters using oral contraceptives (OC) containing 30-50\nmicrograms ethinyl estradiol (EE) daily the mean HRG level was 14% and 24% lower \nthan in a group of 144 mothers and 134 daughters not taking oral contraceptives, \nrespectively (p < 0.05). Finally, in 11 excessively tall prepuberal girls who\nreceived 300 micrograms EE daily to reduce their final height the mean plasma HRG\nlevels were decreased by 68% (p < 0.005). The effect of progestogens administered\nduring low-dose and high-dose estrogen therapy appeared to be minor. The results \nfrom these three studies indicate that estrogens reduce plasma HRG levels in a\ndose-dependent way.\n\nPMID: 7667832  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

PRIMARY\nENDPOINTS: Four endpoints were chosen to represent four biological systems\nrelated to the risk of cardiovascular disease: (1) high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-C), (2) systolic blood pressure, (3) serum insulin, and (4)\nfibrinogen.\nANALYSIS: Analyses presented are by intention to treat. P values for primary\nendpoints are adjusted for multiple comparisons; 95% confidence intervals around \nestimated effects were calculated without this adjustment.\nRESULTS: Mean changes in HDL-C segregated treatment regimens into three\nstatistically distinct groups: (1) placebo (decrease of 0.03 mmol/L [1.2 mg/dL]);\n(2) MPA regimens (increases of 0.03 to 0.04 mmol/L [1.2 to 1.6 mg/dL]); and (3)\nCEE with cyclic MP (increase of 0.11 mmol/L [4.1 mg/dL]) and CEE alone (increase \nof 0.14 mmol/L [5.6 mg/dL]). Active treatments decreased mean low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (0.37 to 0.46 mmol/L [14.5 to 17.7 mg/dL]) and increased \nmean triglyceride (0.13 to 0.15 mmol/L [11.4 to 13.7 mg/dL]) compared with\nplacebo. Placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in mean\nfibrinogen than any active treatment (0.10 g/L compared with -0.02 to 0.06 g/L); \ndifferences among active treatments were not significant. Systolic blood pressure\nincreased and postchallenge insulin levels decreased during the trial, but\nneither varied significantly by treatment assignment. Compared with other active \ntreatments, unopposed estrogen was associated with a significantly increased risk\nof adenomatous or atypical hyperplasia (34% vs 1%) and of hysterectomy (6% vs\n1%). No other adverse effect differed by treatment assignment or hysterectomy\nstatus.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen alone or in combination with a progestin improves\nlipoproteins and lowers fibrinogen levels without detectable effects on\npostchallenge insulin or blood pressure. Unopposed estrogen is the optimal\nregimen for elevation of HDL-C, but the high rate of endometrial hyperplasia\nrestricts use to women without a uterus. In women with a uterus, CEE with cyclic \nMP has the most favorable effect on HDL-C and no excess risk of endometrial\nhyperplasia.\n\nPMID: 7807658  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The estimated probability of\nbeing free from progression after 1 year was 17% for the patients treated with\nestramustine and 29% for the MPA-epirubicin group. There is a significant\ndifference between the two groups regarding risk of progression (p = 0.013).\nHowever, no difference in survival was recorded (p > 0.30) with about 60% of the \npatients dead during the first year in both groups. Progression was highly\ncorrelated to sedimentation rate (p < 0.001) and to performance index (p =\n0.002). Heart failure occurred in a substantial number of patients in both groups\nwhich must be considered before starting therapy.\n\nPMID: 7656906  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Contraception. 1993 May;47(5):445-54.\n\nFasting plasma lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in Nigerian women using\ncombined oral and progestin-only injectable contraceptives.\n\nOyelola OO.\n\nAuthor information: \nChrist Hospital Cardiovascular Research Center, Division of Lipid Metabolism and \nPreventive Atherosclerosis, Cincinnati, OH 45219.\n\nFasting plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein (apo) profiles were\ndetermined in Nigerian women using a low-dose combined oral (Lo-Feminal + Fe) (n \n= 18), a progestin-only injectable (Depo-Provera) (n = 16) contraceptives and\nmatched controls (n = 18). The mean of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL) cholesterol, apo B and Lp(a) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in women \nusing contraceptives than the controls. The mean of total and LDL-cholesterol and\napo B were also significantly higher in the oral contraceptive users than those\non progestin-only injectables. Furthermore, the mean of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) risk indices, total/HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05) and LDL/HDL-cholesterol (p <\n0.01), were significantly higher in women on oral contraceptives than the\ncontrols. There were no statistically significant differences between the indices\nin the women using progestin-only injectables and the controls. Based on this\nfinding, it is concluded that the use of steroidal contraceptives is associated\nwith alterations of lipid and apolipoprotein profiles in Nigerian women and that \nthe use of low-dose combined oral contraceptives may be associated with an\nincreased CVD risk.\n\nPIP: Fasting plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein profiles, and\napolipoprotein fractions were assayed in 18 Nigerian women taking low-dose,\ncombined oral contraceptive (OC), 16 using an injectable progestin, and in 18\ncontrols. The OC, Lo-Feminal + Fe, contained 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 0.3 mg \nnorgestrel, with 7 placebos of 75 mg ferrous fumarate. Depo-Provera (150 mg\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate) was the injectable. Lipids and HDL-cholesterol were \ndetermined on a Hitachi 737 automated chemistry analyzer, and apolipoproteins\nwere assayed by ELISA or electroimmunoassay. Total cholesterol, low-density\ncholesterol (LDL), apo B, and Lp(a) were significantly higher in OC users than in\ncontrols, and total cholesterol, LDL, and apo B were also significantly higher in\nOC users than in injectable users. Cardiovascular disease risk ratios, calculated\nas total cholesterol/HDL, were significantly higher in OC users than in controls,\nbut these ratios did not differ between injectable users and controls. While LDL \nand the atherogenic lipoproteins apo B and Lp(a) were higher in these OC users,\nit is likely that other factors need to be considered, such as age, smoking,\nblood pressure, and glucose tolerance, to estimate the overall risk of\ncardiovascular disease for Nigerian OC users.\nPMID: 8513671  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fifty women who had used DMPA at a dose of 150 mg\nevery three months for 3 to 9 years were recruited in Bangkok, Christchurch and\nMexico City. They were compared to a control group of 120 IUD users. Total\ncholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total triglycerides,\napolipoproteins AI, AII and B were measured throughout one injection interval.\nSignificant findings differed between centres. Compared to their own centre\ncontrols, DMPA users in Bangkok had higher LDL-cholesterol levels; those in\nChristchurch had lower HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) AI and apo AI/B\nratio and higher apo B levels; those in Mexico City had a lower apo AI/B ratio.\nFurther changes were observed during the injection interval, some of which were\ncorrelated to changes in serum MPA levels. It is concluded that long-term use of \nDMPA induces moderate changes in lipid metabolism which are unfavourable in terms\nof risk for atherosclerosis. This should be borne in mind when weighing the\noverall risks and benefits of this contraceptive method for a potential user.\n\nPMID: 8449018  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of 236 patients entered 210 were eligible: 75 received cyproterone\nacetate, 71 medroxyprogesterone acetate and 64 diethylstilbestrol. Local and\ndistant tumor response, time to progression, survival and toxicity were assessed.\nPatients treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate had a less favorable course\nwith a shorter duration of survival and time to progression than those treated\nwith the other 2 drugs. There was no significant difference between\ndiethylstilbestrol and cyproterone acetate. Cardiovascular side effects were\nreported more often in patients treated with diethylstilbestrol than in those\ntreated with cyproterone acetate but severe and lethal cardiovascular toxicity\nwas relatively low in all groups.

The \n239 patients in study 30761 and 226 in study 30762 were evaluated for\ncardiovascular toxicity during treatment. Various types of side effects (fluid\nretention, hypertension, electrocardiographic changes, myocardial infarction and \nthromboembolic disease) and their degrees of severity were analyzed. In both\nstudies the most frequent type of cardiovascular toxicity was represented by\nfluid retention. Cardiovascular toxicity as a whole was higher with\ndiethylstilbestrol than with estramustine phosphate or medroxyprogesterone\nacetate therapy, and was the lowest with cyproterone acetate therapy. The risk of\nsevere cardiovascular complications developing was the highest during the first 6\nmonths of treatment. Increasing age, body weight greater than 75 kg. and,\nespecially, the presence of previous cardiovascular disease represented adverse\nfactors in the development of cardiovascular toxicity.\n\nPMID: 2935644  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Adv Metab Disord. 1971;5:119-47.\n\nThe metabolic influence of progestins.\n\nLandau RL, Poulos JT.\n\nPIP: Information concerning the general metabolic, or what might be termed the\nsystemic, effects of progesterone and synthetic progestins is reviewed. Included \nin the review, are sections on: 1) electrolyte metabolism, 2) protein metabolism,\n3) growth hormone secretion, 4) carbohydrate metabolism, 5) fat metabolism, 6)\nrespiratory effects, 7) the influence of synthetic progestins on electrolyte\nmetabolism, and 8) the effect of synthetic progestins on electrolyte metabolism, \nand 8) the effect of synthetic progestins on protein metabolism. It appears that \naldosterone and progesterone are the dominate endocrine factors regulating salt\nexcretion during pregnancy. As 1 of the sex hormones, progesterone has a distinct\ngrowth-promoting influence on selected tissues of the accessory sex apparatus.\nProgesterone induces protein wasting which can be compensated for by the\ncomsumption of added calories. It appears that progesterone is partially\nresponsible for maintaining the positive energy balance in pregnant women, the\nappetite stimulus arising from the catabolic process which it initiates. Recent\ninterest in the influence of progesterone and synthetic progestins on pituitary\ngrowth hormone secretion has come about both as a by-product of studies done on\nthe effects of progestins on protein and carbohydrate metabolism and because of\nthe known effects of other sex steroids on the output of this hormone. Progestins\nwhether derived from testosterone or 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone when employed\nin the usual antiovulatory doses, and progesterone in amounts comparable to the\nlevels achieved in the first half of pregnancy have no adverse effect on\ncarbohydrate metabolism in normal men or women. However, in diabetics and perhaps\nin potential or prediabetics, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives may cause \nslight deterioration in glucose tolerance. Circumstantial evidence has provided\nmuch support for the idea that some relationship exists between sex hormones and \nserum lipid content. A great number of synthetic and few natural derivatives of\ntestosterone have ben evaluated with the purpose of developing a\npharmacologically effective steroid with the full general protein anabolic\nactivity of the male hormone but with minimal androgenic or virilizing potential.\nPMID: 4934165  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There were 359\nincident cases of CHD during follow-up. After the exclusion of women with\ncardiovascular disease (n = 90), diabetes, or hypertension at baseline (n = 103),\n166 CHD cases were matched to 524 controls on age, randomization date, and\nhysterectomy status. MetS classification required at least three of five Adult\nTreatment Panel III criteria. Analyses by \xcf\x87 and t tests for heterogeneity and\nlogistic regression were performed. Postmenopausal women (n = 27,347) aged 50 to \n79 years from 40 US clinical centers participated. Daily conjugated equine\nestrogens (0.625 mg) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg; EPT) or conjugated \nequine estrogens (0.625 mg; ET) were compared with placebo. The main outcome\nmeasure was the odds for CHD with HT use versus placebo by MetS status.\nRESULTS: MetS modified the risk of CHD events with HT. In the pooled analysis,\nrisk was increased with HT versus placebo in women with MetS (odds ratio, 2.26;\n95% CI, 1.26-4.07), whereas women without MetS were not found to have an\nincreased risk for a CHD event with HT (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.58-1.61; P\nfor interaction = 0.03). Results of the EPT and ET trials, when examined\nseparately, were similar. The constellation of MetS variables was more predictive\nof risk from HT than MetS components assessed individually. When women with\ndiabetes or hypertension were included in the analysis, statistically significant\neffect modification was not detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: MetS at baseline in women without prior cardiovascular disease,\ndiabetes, or hypertension at baseline identifies women who are more likely to\nhave had adverse coronary outcomes on HT. CHD risk stratification is recommended \nbefore initiating HT. The basis for the greater risk of CHD events with HT among \nwomen with MetS requires further study.\n\nPMID: 23435021  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

After 12 months, the women assigned to MPA had lesser increases \nin BMI (p=0.04), triglyceride (p=0.003), HDL (p<0.0005), SHBG (p<0.0005), total\ntestosterone (p=0.003), and CRP values (p=0.01) and higher serum albumin levels\n(p<0.0005) compared with the women receiving CEE.\nCONCLUSION: Therapy with CEE, but not MPA, after surgical menopause appears to\npredispose healthy women to low-grade inflammation, as evidenced by its\nindependent associations with elevated CRP and reduced albumin levels. In women\ntreated with MPA, the favorable levels of inflammatory markers, BMI, and\ntriglyceride levels need to be confirmed in larger controlled trials, as\nprogesterone therapy may provide a safe and effective alternative to estrogen for\nvasomotor symptoms in women with surgical menopause.\n\nPMID: 20411996  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Blood pressure (office and ambulatory), heart rate and\nheart rate variability (HRV) were measured at baseline and following EPT/placebo \ntreatment. In eight women, we used a wire-myograph to assess endothelial function\nand contractile response of subcutaneous arteries to transmural nerve stimulation\n(TNS) and exogenous noradrenaline.\nRESULTS: EPT decreased vascular reactivity to cumulative TNS compared with\nbaseline (p<0.01) and placebo (p<0.05). Moreover, EPT diminished sensitivity to\nexogenous noradrenaline (p<0.05). Although EPT reinforced response to\nacetylcholine, we observed no difference in maximal relaxation induced by\nsubstance P or acetylcholine. EPT did not affect ambulatory blood pressure, heart\nrate or HRV.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral combined medium-term EPT reduces adrenergic reactivity in\nsubcutaneous arteries from treated hypertensive postmenopausal women. EPT might\nact postjunctionally at the adrenergic vascular receptor level. In the present\nstudy, EPT neither reduces sympathetic activity nor increases vagal tone, and\nthus does not support an effect on the central hemodynamic system.\n\nPMID: 19958076  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

During a mean follow-up period \nof 4.5 years, women without hypertension tended to have slightly higher 3MS\nscores than women with hypertension (P=.001), but the difference was not seen\nafter adjustment for covariates (P=.17). Women with hypertension also appeared to\nbe at greater risk for probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n(hazard ratio=1.35, 95% confidence interval=1.07-1.70, P=.01), although when\npotential cofounders were accounted for, this association was no longer\nsignificant (P=.06).\nCONCLUSION: Hypertension and high blood pressure at baseline were not\nindependently associated with MCI or probable dementia over time in older,\ncognitively intact, postmenopausal women enrolled in WHIMS after other potential \nconfounders were taken into account.

We used the\nmicrochannel method to investigate whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with\nconjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) affects\nblood flow through the microchannels in hypertensive postmenopausal women being\ntreated with antihypertensive drugs and in normotensive postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: Sixty-two consecutive postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to a\nhypertensive HRT group (n=16), hypertensive control group (n=15), normotensive\nHRT group (n=16) and normotensive control group (n=15). Each HRT group received\nCEE 0.625 mg plus MPA 2.5 mg daily orally for 12 months. Both hypertensive groups\nwere being treated with antihypertensive drugs before the study. Microvascular\nblood flow was assessed on the basis of blood passage time, the time required for\n100 microl of whole blood to pass through a cylinder, was determined before and\n12 months after the start of HRT by the microchannel method (micro channel array \nflow analyzer).\nRESULTS: CEE plus MPA therapy did not change blood passage time in any of the\ngroups. Microscopic observation showed that the whole blood passed smoothly\nthrough the microchannels in every group.\nCONCLUSIONS: CEE plus MPA therapy may not impair blood flow through the\nmicrochannels in hypertensive postmenopausal women receiving antihypertensive\ndrugs or in normotensive postmenopausal women. However, administration of CEE\nplus MPA to postmenopausal women with hypertension warrants caution against the\noccurrence of thromboembolic events.\n\nPMID: 16040211  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hemostatic\nfactors, i.e., fibrogen, antithrombin, protein C activity, plasminogen activator \ninhibitor-1, D-dimer, and plasminogen, were measured in plasma of all women\nbefore, and 6 and 12 months after the start of study.\nRESULT: The antithrombin levels of the hypertensive and normotensive women who\nreceived HRT had decreased at 6 (both P<0.001) and 12 months (P<0.001 and P<0.01)\nand their D-dimer at 12 months (both P<0.05) and plasminogen levels at 6 (both\nP<0.001) and 12 months (both P<0.001) has increased, but other hemostatic factors\nwere unchanged. There were no changes in hemostatic factors in either control\ngroup.\nCONCLUSION: HRT for 12 months activated blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in\nboth hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women. Administration of CEE\nplus MPA therapy to hypertensive or normotensive postmenopausal women may be\nrelated to the thromboembolic events.\n\nPMID: 15733968  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the present study, we examined the effects of HRT on\noffice BP and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in Japanese hypertensive or\nnormotensive PMW. Thirty-one hypertensive (HT-HRT group) and 17 normotensive PMW \n(NT-HRT group) received HRT (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen combined with\n2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate) orally for 12 months, and 30 hypertensive \n(HT-Control group) and 19 normotensive PMW (NT-Control group) did not receive\nHRT. In all of the hypertensive PMW, BP was controlled by a variety of\nantihypertensive drugs before starting HRT. The hypertensive PMW were divided\ninto two groups according to the results of ABP before HRT: nondippers (those\nwithout a diurnal change in BP) and dippers (those with a diurnal change in BP). \nIn all patients, office BP measurements and 24-h ABPM were performed before and\n12 months after the start of HRT. HRT did not change either the office or the\n24-h ambulatory systolic, diastolic, or mean BP in any of the groups. Therefore, \nHRT did not significantly alter the proportion of nondippers. We conclude that\nwith respect to BP, HRT might not be harmful in hypertensive PMW whose BP has\nbeen well-controlled prior to the initiation of HRT, as well as in normotensive\nPMW.\n\nPMID: 12887127  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, the precise mechanism underlying its benefits\nis unclear. This question was addressed in an electron spin resonance (EPR) study\nof membrane function of erythrocytes in postmenopausal women. The purpose of this\nstudy was to investigate the effects of HRT on membrane fluidity of erythrocytes \nin postmenopausal women by means of the EPR and spin-labeling method.\nMETHODS: The healthy postmenopausal women were randomly divided into the HRT\ngroup (n = 14) receiving the conjugated estrogen with medroxyprogesterone for 3\nmonths and the non-HRT control group (n = 14). We measured membrane fluidity of\nerythrocytes in postmenopausal women before and after the trial period.\nRESULTS: The HRT group showed a significant decrease in blood pressure (BP) after\ntreatment (systolic BP 145.7 +/- 5.5 v 123.3 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, n = 14, mean +/- SEM,\nP <.05). The order parameter (S) for 5-nitroxide stearate in the EPR spectra of\nerythrocyte membranes decreased significantly in the HRT group (S: 0.718 +/-\n0.002 v 0.695 +/- 0.002, n = 14, P <.01). The finding indicated that HRT\nincreased the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes and improved the microviscosity\nof the cell membranes in postmenopausal women.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HRT might have\na beneficial effect on the membrane rheologic behavior of erythrocytes and the\nmicrocirculation in postmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 12799102  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We investigated whether the serum HGF level differs between\nhypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women (PMW) and whether hormone\nreplacement therapy (HRT) alters the serum HGF level and blood pressure in\nhypertensive and normotensive PMW.\nDESIGN: Prospective observational study.\nMETHODS: A total of 33 PMW with mild to moderate essential hypertension\ncontrolled by antihypertensive treatment (mean age, 57 +/- 6 years) and 23\nnormotensive PMW (mean age, 57 +/- 7 years) received continuous HRT (0.625 mg of \nconjugated equine estrogen combined with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate)\nonce a day orally for 12 months, and we measured serum HGF levels and blood\npressure before and 12 months after the start of HRT.\nRESULTS: The baseline serum HGF level was significantly higher in hypertensive\nPMW than in normotensive PMW. HRT significantly decreased the serum HGF level in \nhypertensive subjects, from 2.85 +/- 0.64 pmol/l to 2.49 +/- 0.65 pmol/l (P <\n0.001), but not in normotensive subjects. HRT did not change blood pressure in\neither group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum HGF level before the start of HRT was higher in the\nhypertensive PMW than in the normotensive PMW. Furthermore, HRT decreases serum\nHGF without decreasing blood pressure in hypertensive PMW. The HRT-induced\ndecrease in serum HGF was greater in hypertensive PMW than in normotensive PMW,\nand the decrease was independent of blood pressure changes.\n\nPMID: 12777952  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We hypothesized that hypertensive and/or\noverweight women may be less likely to realize cardiovascular benefits from\nestrogen.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We administered micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg or\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)\n0.625 mg daily during 2 months to 35 hypertensive and/or overweight\npostmenopausal women with a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. With\nsignificant changes of lipoproteins, CEE+MP or MPA significantly improved\nflow-mediated dilation and reduced plasma E-selectin, intercellular adhesion\nmolecule type-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis\nfactor-alpha levels (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.021, P<0.001, and P<0.001 by ANOVA,\nrespectively), but not C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels. Of note, there\nwere no significant differences between each therapy regarding these effects.\nHowever, the magnitude of improvement of flow-mediated dilation in these women\nwas less than in healthy postmenopausal women and more than in diabetic\npostmenopausal women reported by our previous studies. The effects of CEE+MP or\nMPA on inflammatory markers were comparable to healthy postmenopausal women, but \nnot comparable to diabetic postmenopausal women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Estrogen combined with synthetic progestin significantly improved\nflow-mediated brachial artery dilator response and reduced inflammation markers\nin hypertensive and/or overweight women, comparable to estrogen combined with\nnatural progesterone.\n\nPMID: 12231566  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

At baseline, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, the BP\nwith standard sphygmomanometer and with 24-h ambulatory recording method was\nevaluated in two periods (from day 10 through day 16 of the cycle and from day 20\nthrough day 27 of the cycle). At the same time, we also evaluated total\ncholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides, and fibrinogen levels.\nRESULTS: After 3 and 6 months of treatment, no significant variations of systolic\nand diastolic BP measured with standard sphygmomanometer were detected in both\ngroups. On the contrary, in group A in comparison with basal values and group P, \nand without difference between the two phases of treatment, the 24-h recording\nshowed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in BP. No significant variations were\ndetected in group P versus baseline. In particular, we observed in group A at 3\nmonths of treatment a significant (P<0.05) decrease only in daytime BP in\ncomparison with basal values and group P, without difference between the two\nphases of treatment. Indeed, the decrease in daytime BP was significant (P<0.05) \nfor both systolic and diastolic BP. At 3 and 6 months a significant (P<0.05)\ndecrease in total cholesterol, LDL-c and fibrinogen levels was detected in group \nA versus baseline and group P. HDL-c and triglyceride concentrations showed no\nsignificant variations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The transdermal HRT induces a significant reduction of BP values and\na favorable metabolic action in postmenopausal hypertensive patients.\n\nPMID: 11684376  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Am J Hypertens. 2001 Jul;14(7 Pt 1):699-703.\n\nEffect of combination hormone replacement therapy on ambulatory blood pressure\nand arterial stiffness in diabetic postmenopausal women.\n\nHayward CS(1), Samaras K, Campbell L, Kelly RP.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Cardiac Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.\nchayward@stvincents.com.au\n\nBACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus negates the premenopausal gender benefit with\nrespect to coronary artery disease. Whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\noffers any cardiovascular advantage to diabetic postmenopausal women is not\nknown. Diabetic subjects have increased vascular load and abnormal 24-h blood\npressure (BP) profiles. Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to improve\nindexes of arterial load in nondiabetic postmenopausal women as well as to\nrestore circadian variation in BP. This aim of this study, therefore, was to\ndetermine prospectively whether HRT improved arterial stiffness and 24-h\nambulatory BP profile in diabetic postmenopausal women.\nMETHODS: Twelve diabetic postmenopausal women were studied. Six subjects were\nalso hypertensive. Vascular load was characterized by carotid arterial pulse\nwaveform analysis to calculate central augmentation index. All subjects also\nunderwent 24-h BP monitoring. Subjects were studied before commencement of HRT\nand were then randomized to two groups. The first group was observed for 6 months\nand then given 2 months of estrogen alone, followed by 4 months of combination\nestrogen with progestin. The second group received the HRT regimen first, then\nwere restudied after 6 months off HRT.\nRESULTS: The HRT did not affect either clinic or ambulatory BP. There were no\nchanges in indexes of vascular load or pulse pressure, an indirect measure of\narterial stiffness. There was a low rate of circadian variation in 24-h BP at\nbaseline (55%), which was unaltered by HRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HRT was well tolerated. Despite evidence for a beneficial effect\nof HRT on indexes of arterial load and ambulatory BP previously reported in\nnormal subjects, we found no change in this cohort of diabetic postmenopausal\nwomen.\n\nPMID: 11465656  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Menopause. 2001 May-Jun;8(3):210-5.\n\nEffect of long-term hormone replacement therapy on angiotensin-converting enzyme \nactivity and bradykinin in postmenopausal women with essential hypertension and\nnormotensive postmenopausal women.\n\nNogawa N(1), Sumino H, Ichikawa S, Kumakura H, Takayama Y, Nakamura T, Kanda T,\nMizunuma H, Kurabayashi M.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Cardiovascular Hospital of Central Japan, Gunma.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces the incidence of\ncardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Three-month short-term HRT in\npostmenopausal women with essential hypertension increased the plasma\nconcentrations ofbradykinin with decreased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) activity, which may be partially responsible for the cardioprotective\neffects of HRT. The objective was to determine whether 12-month long-term HRT in \npostmenopausal women with essential hypertension would maintain the decreased ACE\nactivity and increased bradykinin levels and whether long-term HRT would increase\nthe plasma bradykinin concentrations of normotensive postmenopausal women who had\nshown no significant changes in the 3-month HRT study, despite their decreased\nserum ACE activity.\nDESIGN: Twenty hypertensive and 15 normotensive postmenopausal women were treated\nwith conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day) and medroxyprogesterone (2.5 mg/day) for\n12 months. Twenty hypertensive and 15 normotensive postmenopausal women were used\nas controls. The controls were not treated with HRT. Serum ACE activity and\nplasma bradykinin concentrations were measured at baseline and at 12 months.\nRESULTS: Long-term HRT in both hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women\nsignificantly decreased serum ACE activity from 15.5+/-0.7 IU/L and 16.0+/-0.9\nIU/L, respectively, at baseline to 13.3+/-0.5 IU/L and 14.2+/-0.9 IU/L,\nrespectively, 12 months after the start of HRT (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05,\nrespectively). Long-term HRT in both hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal\nwomen also significantly increased plasma bradykinin concentrations from\n22.1+/-4.4 pg/mL and 19.2+/-3.0 pg/mL, respectively, at baseline to 86.7+/-21.2\npg/mL and 73.5+/-23.0 pg/mL, respectively, 12 months after the start of HRT (p < \n0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). No significant changes in serum ACE activity or\nplasma bradykinin concentrations were observed in the control groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term HRT in hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women \ndecreases their serum ACE activity and increases their plasma bradykinin\nconcentrations. Thus, maintenance of elevated bradykinin with decreased serum ACE\nactivity by HRT may be useful in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in\nboth hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women.\n\nPMID: 11355044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

They were randomized at a trial in two \ngroups with pursuit of 6 months. Group A: 53 with captopril, Group B: 53 with\nestradiol-medroxyprogesterone. The arterial pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides \nand symptoms hypoestrogenism were analyzed before and after the treatment. The\nstatistical analysis was performed with Student T.\nRESULTS: A decrease of arterial pressure was observed with estradiol, the same as\nwith captopril with a p < 0.05. Decrease of cholesterol and triglycerides were\nmore significant in the estradiol group with a p < 0.05. A bigger attenuation of \nsymptoms of the hypoestrogenism existed in the estradiol group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The antihypertensive response with estradiol was the same as with\ncaptopril in the premenopausal patient with systemic hypertension.\n\nPMID: 11195960  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There were \nfour randomised treatment phases, each lasting 4 weeks. The four treatments were \nCEE 0.3 mg, CEE 0.625 mg, CEE 1.25 mg and placebo. Each subject also received\nnon-blinded medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg for the final 14 days of each\n28-day treatment cycle. Clinic blood pressure was measured weekly with the mean\nvalues of weeks 3 and 4 of each phase used for analysis. Ambulatory blood\npressure was performed in week 4 of each phase.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo, clinic systolic blood pressure was reduced in the\nCEE 0.3 mg and CEE 0.625 mg phases (p < 0.05) and clinic diastolic blood pressure\nwas reduced in the CEE 0.625 mg phase (p < 0.05). There was no significant effect\nof CEE on ambulatory blood pressure, although the blood pressure pattern was\nsimilar to clinic measurements.\nCONCLUSION: In hypertensive postmenopausal women, daily CEE together with\ncyclical MPA has a variable effect on blood pressure depending on CEE dose. The\n"lower" and "middle" doses of CEE produced a small reduction in blood pressure\nwhich reached a nadir and tended to reverse with the "higher" CEE dose.\n\nPMID: 11193131  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Kjohnson@utmem.edu\n\nOBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between baseline hypertension, blood\npressure, and the development of cognitive decline in participants in the Women's\nHealth Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS).\nDESIGN: Prospective analyses.\nSETTING: Thirty-nine centers.\nPARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand one hundred forty-nine women aged 65 and older.\nMEASUREMENTS: The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) was used to assess\nglobal cognitive functioning. Participants who scored below pre-established\ncutpoints were scheduled for more-extensive neurocognitive assessments. Results\nfrom these assessments were centrally adjudicated.\nRESULTS: The mean age of this group of 7,149 participants at baseline was 71.0\n+/- 3.8, and the mean 3MS score was 95.2 +/- 4.3. During a mean follow-up period \nof 4.5 years, women without hypertension tended to have slightly higher 3MS\nscores than women with hypertension (P=.001), but the difference was not seen\nafter adjustment for covariates (P=.17). Women with hypertension also appeared to\nbe at greater risk for probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n(hazard ratio=1.35, 95% confidence interval=1.07-1.70, P=.01), although when\npotential cofounders were accounted for, this association was no longer\nsignificant (P=.06).\nCONCLUSION: Hypertension and high blood pressure at baseline were not\nindependently associated with MCI or probable dementia over time in older,\ncognitively intact, postmenopausal women enrolled in WHIMS after other potential \nconfounders were taken into account. These analyses should not be viewed as\ndiscouraging appropriate medical treatment for hypertension.\n\nPMID: 18637980  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Fasting\nblood samples were collected at baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 months of\ntreatment for measurement of serum concentrations of cholesterol by means of\ngas-liquid chromatography; 24S-hydroxycholesterol (cerebrosterol), lathosterol,\nand the plant sterol campesterol by means of gas-liquid chromatography-mass\nspectrometry. The analyses were performed retrospectively from serum samples\nstored at -70 degrees C for 5 years.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four months of treatment with raloxifene 150 mg was associated\nwith a significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations (-10%, P =\n0.007). The ratio of 24S-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol, a serum marker of\nbrain cholesterol metabolism, showed a significant increase after 6 and 12 months\nwith raloxifene 150 mg but not after 24 months (P = 0.001). The ratio of\nlathosterol to cholesterol, a marker of whole-body cholesterol synthesis,\nincreased with raloxifene 60 mg (P = 0.163), raloxifene 150 mg (P < 0.001), as\nwell as with HT (P = 0.005). The ratio of campesterol to cholesterol, a marker of\ncholesterol absorption rate, was significantly reduced with HT (P = 0.002).\nCONCLUSION: Two-year treatment with raloxifene or HT had no influence on brain\ncholesterol metabolism, while whole-body cholesterol synthesis, assessed by the\nratio of lathosterol to cholesterol, increased during raloxifene and HT.\n\nPMID: 15780532  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ogen/Provera Study Group.\n\nNand SL(1), Webster MA, Baber R, Heller GZ.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)School of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal Hospital for Women, Barker Street,\nRandwick, NSW, 2031, Australia.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To establish the optimum oral daily dose of micronized\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), given in combination with 1.25 mg of estrone\nsulfate for menopausal symptom control.\nMETHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted on 568\npostmenopausal women who were randomized to take estrone sulfate 1.25 mg daily\nwith 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg of MPA daily for 2 years. The number of vasomotor symptoms\nand the severity of mood swings, lethargy, vaginal dryness and loss of libido as \nwell as side-effects were recorded in a diary. Blood pressure and weight were\nrecorded at each 3-month visit.\nRESULTS: Vasomotor symptoms were reported by approximately 80% of subjects at\nmonth 1, 23% at month 3 but only 9% by month 24. Mood swings, lethargy and\nvaginal dryness improved rapidly in the initial 3 months of therapy. Decrease in \nlibido had a slower response to therapy in all three treatment groups. Breast\ntenderness was the commonest side-effect with 22% of subjects complaining of this\nin the first 3 months of therapy, dropping to 13% by 6 months. Headache,\ndepression, nausea, bloating and irritability showed a similar pattern of\ndecline. There was no significant difference in the rate of decrease in\nmenopausal symptoms or reported side-effects between the three treatment groups. \nThere was a small but significant (p < 0.001) decrease in systolic and diastolic \nblood pressure over the study period.\nCONCLUSIONS: All three treatment regimens provide adequate symptom control.\nSide-effects decreased markedly after the first 3 months, with no significant\ndifference between the treatment groups.\n\nPMID: 11913409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There\nwere no objective responders among the eight patients treated with recombinant\ngamma-interferon at an i.v. dose of 1 mg/m(2) daily for five days every other\nweek for four weeks then 1 mg/m(2) three times a week given every other week\nuntil there was documented disease progression or complete response (CR). Overall\nmedian survival was 17.3 months (range 1.4 to 184). The major side effects of\ntreatment included fever/chills (75%), mild anorexia and fatigue (75%),\nnausea/vomiting (80%), leukopenia (38%), and abnormal liver function tests (25%).\nThere were no life-threatening side effects observed. At our institution, in a\nrandom cohort of eight patients with metastatic RCC, recombinant gamma-interferon\nwhen given at a dose of 1 mg/m(2) per day given three times per week on an every \nother week schedule yields no clinical antitumor activity. A review of the\nliterature on the use of gamma-interferon for metastatic RCC suggests that\nlow-dose combination therapy with other cytokines may yield the best\nresponse-to-side effect ratio. Higher doses yield more responses but an added\ncost of more toxicity.\n\nPMID: 8610639  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thus, in\norder to obtain a prompt improvement, the association of local therapy acting on \nthe genital epithelium to the systemic treatment should be considered.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a combined therapy consisting of vaginal\nestriol with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol (50 microg/day) plus\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg/day) per os in shortening the period of\nuro-genital symptoms.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a randomized, double blind, controlled with placebo\nstudy, 27 women with climacteric symptoms and atrophic vaginitis were treated for\n4 months with HT plus vaginal estriol 0.5 mg/day (group E) or placebo (group P). \nPatients use the local medication daily for the first 3 weeks and twice-weekly\nthereafter. Before entering in the study, patients were asked about HT and\nselected for inclusion. In the first visit, electible patients after written\ninformed consent were randomized to receive HT plus local estriol or placebo. All\nthe subjects had baseline studies, including medical history, physical\nexamination, blood and urine analysis. In order to evaluate the effect of local\ntreatment on urinary and genital symptoms, a score for genital, urinary and\ncolposcopic complaints (0 minimum-100 maximum) was developed. This score and\nBlatt-Kuperman were recorded and performed in every control.\nRESULTS: There were no differences on climacteric symptoms relief between the two\ngroups. Additionally, the improvement in urinary symptoms at the end of the study\nwas similar for both groups (from 16.5 +/- 6.1 to 8.5 +/- 2.4 for E group and\nfrom 15.8 +/- 7.8 to 8.8 +/- 2.7 for P group; P < 0.01 versus basal); however,\nthose women in group E reached significant improvement on urinary complaints\nsince the first month of treatment. Additionally, a significant difference\nbetween E and P was observed at months 2 and 3, although no differences were\ndetected at the end of the study. Papanicolaou smear showed reactive or\nreparative changes and karyopyknotic index exhibited a significant increase in\nsuperficial cells in both groups and at the end of the study.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adding vaginal estriol to HRT may shorten the latency period for\nurinary symptoms.\n\nPMID: 15653006  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 5 year follow-up of 82 patients after\nhigh-dose gestagen treatment.\n\nLindahl B(1), Will\xc3\xa9n R.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.\n\nEndometrial hyperplasia was proposed as a predecessor to endometrial carcinoma\nalready at the end of the 19th century. However, there have been different\nopinions regarding this view. The treatment also varies, but generally cyclic\nprogesterone at a dose of 10 mg a day is used. In order to investigate whether\nendometrial hyperplasia is a premalignant state and also whether a high-dose\ngestagen treatment would cure a high proportion of these patients, a prospective \nrandomised study was started in 1982. We now present the 5 year follow-up\nconsisting of 82 patients treated with high-dose gestagen. In this study 19 out\nof 82 patients had hysterectomies (2 due to hyperplasia and 11 due to bleeding), \nalmost the same frequency as in a previous report with patients followed-up with \nabrasio only, but now mainly due to bleeding problems. In summary, no carcinoma\ndeveloped and the hyperplasia was cured with 500 mg MPA i.m. twice weekly for\nthree months. However, the bleeding problems, though almost always only spotting,\nremained, leading to a frequency of hysterectomy that was still too high. We find\nlatter clinical problem an enigma. Further studies are therefore in progress in\nour group which try to identify other treatment modalities for those patients\nwith bleeding problems or who redeveloped hyperplasia after abrasio, in order to \navoid hysterectomies.\n\nPMID: 7872726  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Endometrial\nbiopsies were taken under hysteroscopic control before treatment and on days 8-12\nof combined therapy at the 6th month. Follow-up at 12 and 18 months was only\nperformed in 8 and 5 patients, respectively, with transdermal 17 beta-oestradiol \ntreatment. Various types of endometrial response were identified from atrophy to \nhyperplasia and secretory patterns. No atypical hyperplasia was found. All cases \nof simple or complex hyperplasia showed a regression after increased MPA dosage\ntreatment (20 mg). This work is aimed at investigating the endometrial response\nduring sequential cyclic therapy by using morphologic criteria based on\nhysteroscopy and histology. A large number of patients with hyperplasia can be\ndetected with target biopsy under hysteroscopy, thus playing an important role in\nthe management of patients during replacement therapy in research protocols.\n\nPMID: 1334524  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There was a large ulcer from her left anterior chest to her right side \nchest. After pathological examination from the ulcer, she was diagnosed as breast\ncancer, scirrhous carcinoma. The estrogen and progesterone receptors were\npositive in the tumor. HER2 score was 1+ in the tumor. The stage was\nT4bNxM1(OTH). Uterine metastases of the breast cancer caused obstructive\nnephropathy. Ureteral obstruction was treated by urinary tract catheter. After\nimprovement of renal failure, chemotherapy with 5-FU+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide \n(FEC) and docetaxel was performed. The efficacy was judged as stable disease\n(SD). For third-line chemotherapy, she was then treated with oral combination\nchemoendocrine therapy with capecitabine and medroxyprogesterone acetate. After\nthe combination chemoendocrine therapy, the local tumor was remarkably reduced.\nWith added cyclophosphamide, the partial response (PR) continued for 19 months.\nShe died of peritonitis carcinomatosa and pleuritis carcinomatosa. No adverse\nreactions occurred with the combination chemoendocrine therapy. It is suggested\nthat this oral combination chemoendocrine therapy may be useful with\nconsideration for treatment effectiveness and the quality of life of the patient.\n\nPMID: 19755825  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

An 11-year-old\ndomestic shorthair intact queen was presented for reduced appetite, polyuria,\npolydipsia, abdominal distension, and mammary mass. Pyometra was diagnosed based \nupon clinical, ultrasonographic and radiographic examinations. Mastectomy and\novariohysterectomy (OHE) were performed for treatment. Bilateral ovarian cysts\nwere detected during OHE. Histopathologically, follicular ovarian cysts, CEH-P,\nand benign and neoplastic mammary lesions were identified. We suggest that, the\npathological abnormalities may have been attributed to adverse effects of\nprolonged administration of MPA.\n\nPMID: 19058986  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A\n49-year-old premenopausal woman with a left breast tumor was admitted to our\nhospital for acute weakness of the lower limbs and dysuria. She could neither\nstand nor walk. The tumor in the left breast was 5.0 cm in diameter with skin\nulcer, and it was diagnosed as breast cancer. Magnetic resonance (MR) image\nshowed multiple vertebral and spinal metastases from breast cancer. Chemotherapy,\nconsisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) was\ninitiated. Her symptoms dramatically changed for the better. She became able to\nwalk and urinate. We performed palliative mastectomy after 3 cycles of CAF\ntherapy.

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin. Recurrent AEH had undergone malignant transformation,\nresulting in the development of well- and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma\nand tumor exhibiting germ-cell-like differentiation. The patient died of a\nmassive tumor extension 7 months after surgery. The AEH before MPA therapy and\nthe recurrent tumors had genetically different characteristics based on evidence \nof a loss of heterozygosity, detected at D8S1132 (chromosomal locus, 8q22.1) in\nthe latter but not in the former, by analysis of genetic alterations using\nmicrosatellite markers.\n\nPMID: 15144406  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Three years later she showed multiple bone metastases with\nelevation of CEA, and 5'-DFUR 1,200 mg/day and MPA 800 mg/day were administered. \nTwo years later her CEA levels were decreased, 5'-DFUR was discontinued and MPA\n1,200 mg/day only was continued.

The estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status of the primary\ntumor was unknown. Ten years after the surgery, a metastatic liver tumor was\ndetected, and chemoendocrine therapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin,\n5-fluorouracil (CEF) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) was initiated. The\nmetastatic liver tumor showed a partial response after 11 cycles of such\nchemoendocrine therapy. Subsequently, MPA alone was given daily as maintenance\ntherapy, and the disease has remained stable for 6 years. For women with\nmetastatic breast cancer, complete remission is uncommon, and stable disease is a\nreasonable goal of successful therapy. In this respect, chemoendocrine therapy\nwith CEF and MPA, followed by MPA alone as maintenance therapy, was successful in\nthe patient reported here. Importantly, the patient's quality of life has\nremained favorable for several years after the partial response was achieved.\n\nPMID: 11828951  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

However, it\nis not known for certain whether the lesion is completely eradicated in such\npatients. We present a case of residual endometrial carcinoma after term\npregnancy which had been treated conservatively before the pregnancy began.\nCASE: A 28-year-old woman with endometrial carcinoma received conservative\ntreatment with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and then conceived.\nAfter delivery at term, atypical cells were found in the endometrial curettage\nspecimen. A hysterectomy was performed 6 months after delivery and revealed the\npresence of a small focus of intramucosal, grade 1, endometrioid-type\nadenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for estrogen\nand progesterone receptors.\nCONCLUSION: We concluded that while MPA treatment had been effective, it had not \ncompletely eradicated the carcinomatous lesion, which remained during and after\nthe term pregnancy.\n\nCopyright 2000 Academic Press.\n\nPMID: 11006045  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

But in poor cases, like renal failure and such, it is\ndifficult to perform the therapy. Two cases of recurrent uterine endometrial\ncancer treated earlier with MPA were presently treated with an addition of\netoposide. The first case was given etoposide (50 mg/m2/day 4 times for 21 days\nby oral administration). The target tumor mass was reduced in size, occult blood \nvanished, and the tumor marker was reduced. The other case was treated with\netoposide, 50 mg/body/day for 21 days by oral administration, but because of\ndiarrhea, the dose had to be decreased to 25 mg/body/day every day. The tumor\nmarker was reduced and genital bleeding vanished. These cases suggested that\netoposide-MPA combined therapy might be effective for recurrent uterine\nendometrial cancer of well-differentiated type.\n\nPMID: 7826070  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A radiation pneumonitis was also\nobserved in other patients treated in the same way. Medroxyprogesterone acetate\nthus seems to act as a radiosensitizer since no such effects were seen in\npatients treated with radiotherapy alone. The radioenhancing effect is not\nlimited to the lungs, since radioesofagitis was also encountered in similarly\ntreated patients.\n\nPMID: 2994878  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is\nsuggested that special attention be paid to liver function during simultaneous\nMPA and tamoxifen administration; in case of adverse liver reaction during the\ncombined treatment, a formula of sequential administration of the drugs could be \nimplemented.\n\nPMID: 6235770  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This diagnosis was\nconfirmed by hysterectomy. Cases such as the one presented here are extremely\nrare, since medroxyprogesterone is commonly used to cure endometrial cancer. It\nis possible, that the adenocarcinoma was not hormone dependent since the patient \nwas not yet menopausal, obese, or diabetic, and the dose of medroxyprogesterone\nused was insufficient to stop the evolution of the endometrial carcinoma. In the \npublished literature there are no cases similar to the one presented here. In\ncase of persistent metrorrhagia in patients treated with medroxyprogesterone\nacetate, an exploratory curettage is absolutely necessary.\nPMID: 7323568  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

On a smear taken from the vagina of a 73-year-old woman, cells\nconsistent with adenocarcinoma were detected even though the patient was\nasymptomatic. The specimen from endometrial curettage was normal on microscopic\nexamination. The patient was readmitted, 2 months after dilatation and curettage,\nwith a right pleural effusion. Examination of the pleural fluid revealed\nadenocarcinomatous cells. Laparotomy disclosed a primary carcinoma (stage IV) of \nthe left fallopian tube. Thiotepa (45 mg) was instilled into the chest cavity and\nmedroxyprogesterone (100 mg tid) and melphalan (6 mg/d for 4 days over 6 weeks)\nwere given.

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Teutonia Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53209, USA.\npetfxr@wi.rr.com\n\nIn this case series, three unrelated male housemate cats were treated repeatedly \nwith injections of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for intercat aggression and \nurinary house soiling. All three cats subsequently developed multiple recurrent\nmammary adenocarcinomas and underwent numerous surgical resections. This report\ndescribes the clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in\nthese three cats and highlights the potential for mammary carcinomas to develop\nin male cats years after receiving MPA injections.

An 11-year-old\ndomestic shorthair intact queen was presented for reduced appetite, polyuria,\npolydipsia, abdominal distension, and mammary mass. Pyometra was diagnosed based \nupon clinical, ultrasonographic and radiographic examinations. Mastectomy and\novariohysterectomy (OHE) were performed for treatment. Bilateral ovarian cysts\nwere detected during OHE. Histopathologically, follicular ovarian cysts, CEH-P,\nand benign and neoplastic mammary lesions were identified. We suggest that, the\npathological abnormalities may have been attributed to adverse effects of\nprolonged administration of MPA.\n\nPMID: 19058986  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Admission records\nwere used to identify subjects who received at least 100 mg daily of oral MPA.\nThe primary outcome of successful treatment was chart documentation of a\nsubstantial decline in IH, such that subjects could return to preadmission\nresidence. Data were collected to assess trends in dose, adverse effects, use of \nother symptom-modifying medications prior to MPA initiation, and successful\nreturn to preadmission placement. A trial serotoneric agent was used in 70% of\nsubjects prior to MPA initiation. Sixty percent of subjects failed a trial of an \nantipsychotic, while 40% did not have response to the use of both a serotonergic \nagent and an antipsychotic before MPA was initiated. The average daily dose of\nMPA was 300 mg (range 100-400 mg/day). No adverse effects were documented from\nphysician, nursing, or behavioral health rounding notes; however, adverse effects\nmay not have been systematically assessed at the time of MPA administration.\nSeventy percent of subjects experienced favorable changes in target behaviors\nfrom MPA.\nDISCUSSION: Few data exist on effective therapy options for treatment of IH. The \nminimum concentration of MPA needed to suppress IH in the male body is unknown.\nMPA was titrated upward, with the efficacy measure being a decrease in\ninappropriate behaviors. Use of MPA likely contributed to decreased IH; however, \nother factors involved in hospitalization could have contributed to improved\nbehavior.\nCONCLUSIONS: While requiring further study, high-dose (100-400 mg/day) oral MPA\nmay represent an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for subjects\ndisplaying IH.\n\nPMID: 23324505  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Between 64-76% of patients who receive injections report\nsubjective pain improvement. Injections are usually well-tolerated with only\nmild, transient side effects, although a few case reports of patients with\nadverse effects do appear in the literature. Some clinicians have expressed\nconcerns about epidural injections above the C7-T1 level, and in the use of\nmethylprednisolone epidurally; as yet, neither is a consensus viewpoint.\nPURPOSE: This case report describes severe adverse effects (quadriplegia and\nrespiratory arrest) associated with an epidural injection into the C6-C7 space.\nAlthough the patient's symptoms improved somewhat with supportive care,\nquadriparesis appears irreversible. No reports of quadriparesis after cervical\nepidural injection were found in the literature, although other adverse effects\nhave been reported.\nSTUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The patient was injected by a fellowship-trained pain\nmanagement specialist in an outpatient surgicenter using C-arm fluoroscopic\nguidance. Immediately he experienced respiratory arrest with quadriplegia. He was\nintubated and transferred to the hospital, then transferred again to Christiana\nHealth Care Services.\nMETHODS: The patient was hospitalized, treated with steroid protocol within 8\nhours, and followed clinically for 6 months.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging within 6 hours of the injury and 6 months\nlater showed no significant findings aside from lordosis (40 degrees angle) of\nthe cervical spine at the C6-C7 level.\nCONCLUSION: Although evidence is not conclusive, this patient may have suffered a\nvascular event from a cervical epidural injection.\n\nPMID: 16153586  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A\n49-year-old premenopausal woman with a left breast tumor was admitted to our\nhospital for acute weakness of the lower limbs and dysuria. She could neither\nstand nor walk. The tumor in the left breast was 5.0 cm in diameter with skin\nulcer, and it was diagnosed as breast cancer. Magnetic resonance (MR) image\nshowed multiple vertebral and spinal metastases from breast cancer. Chemotherapy,\nconsisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) was\ninitiated. Her symptoms dramatically changed for the better. She became able to\nwalk and urinate. We performed palliative mastectomy after 3 cycles of CAF\ntherapy. Histopathological findings of breast tumor showed scirrhous carcinoma.\nAlthough the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of primary tumor was\nnegative, chemo-endocrine therapy, consisting of medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MPA) and doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) was given as daily therapy, and vertebral and\nspinal lesions were reduced. Her condition has remained stable for 4 years. For\npatients with metastatic breast cancer, complete remission is uncommon, and\ndisease stabilization is a reasonable goal of successful therapy. In this\nrespect, therapy with CAF, followed by MPA and 5'-DFUR, was successful in the\npatient.\n\nPMID: 15628761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The serum concentration of phenytoin was well \ncontrolled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later,\ncombination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100\nmg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further\nmetastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with\nthe antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to\nfourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but\ntoxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin\nconcentration after its withdrawal.\nDISCUSSION: A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin\nmetabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The\ninteraction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it\nis reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure\nof rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the\nlikeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of\nclinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum\nphenytoin concentration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentrations when phenytoin is given in combination with fluorouracil\nderivatives, including 5'-DFUR.\n\nPMID: 11978162  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Results are conflicting as to whether there is a link between \nthe two. We describe three patients who experienced cerebral embolism during HRT.\nA 73-year-old woman had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 6 years prior to the\npresent admission. She then took HRT oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate\nfor about 6 years. The HRT had been prescribed by a gynaecologist for\namelioration of postmenopausal symptoms. Six years after beginning HRT, she\nexperienced sudden onset left hemiparesis due to cerebral embolism. Two other\npatients had been taking HRT for breast cancers. One, a 47-year-old woman, had\ntaken medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than one year, for recurrence of\nbreast cancer. She had developed sudden complete left hemiparesis due to an\nembolism at the carotid bifurcation. The other patient, a 72-year-old woman who\nwas taking tamoxifen citrate for prevention of breast cancer relapse, experienced\ncerebral embolism just 2 months after beginning tamoxifen. The risk of cerebral\nembolism in those on HRT should be emphasized, along with the beneficial effects \nin terms of postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of breast cancer recurrence.\n\nPMID: 11422601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The first alendronate administration markedly \nalleviated her bone pain. She obtained complete pain relief after the 4th\nalendronate infusion. However, an elevation of tumor marker levels in serum\nwithout any pain increase forced us to treat her with medroxyprogesterone acetate\nand doxifluridine in addition to the alendronate therapy. With these therapies,\nshe has shown an objective response (PR) of the bone metastasis for 8 months. In \nconclusion, alendronate therapy was effective against bone pain due to metastasis\nof breast cancer.\n\nPMID: 10791010  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Apropos of a case].\n\n[Article in Spanish]\n\nCalzada-Sierra DJ(1), Ferm\xc3\xadn-Hern\xc3\xa1ndez E, Vasallo-Prieto R, G\xc3\xb3mez-Fern\xc3\xa1ndez L,\nSantana de la F\xc3\xa9 A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Centro Internacional de Restauraci\xc3\xb3n Neurol\xc3\xb3gica, CIREN, La Habana, Cuba.\ndanny@neuro.sld.cu\n\nINTRODUCTION: Cyclical sciatica due to implantation of endometrial tissue in the \nsciatic nerve in the region of the sciatic notch is a very unusual cause of\nsciatica. It occurs in women of childbearing age, as episodes of pain in the\ndistribution of the sciatic nerve, which present in a cyclic manner and coincide \nwith menstruation. If it is not treated, a sensomotor mononeuropathy of the\nsciatic nerve develops.\nCLINICAL CASE: The patient had complained of right-sided sciatic pain from the\nage of 36 years. Over the years a motor deficit had slowly and progressively\nappeared causing foot drop. The painful crises were related to her menstrual\nperiods. At the age of 44 years a pyramidal muscle syndrome was diagnosed and\ntreated surgically. This was followed by increase in the crises of sciatic pain. \nA year later, she started to have sciatic pain on the left side, which was\nsimilar to that of the right side. The clinical, imaging and electrophysiological\nfindings are reported. The patient improved. She is still being treated with\ndepot medroxyprogesterone and her pain has disappeared.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cyclical sciatica due to endometriosis is little known and may lead \nto permanent disability. Computerized axial tomography of the pelvis using\ncontrast material is very useful for diagnosis. The use of depot\nmedroxyprogesterone seems to be a satisfactory treatment in some patients.\n\nPMID: 10528307  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 49-year-old woman suffering from metastatic lung\ncarcinoma from breast carcinoma was administered MPA 1200 mg/day for about four\nmonths. Thereafter she complained of dizziness about two weeks but the general\npractitioners could detect no abnormality on physical examinations and on brain\nCT X-ray findings. Six days later, she died suddenly at her home. Forensic\nautopsy findings revealed the marked superior sagital sinus thrombosis and the\nmalignant lymphadenomatosis caused by metastatic lung carcinoma. As the patient\nhad not disease or trauma causing dural sinus thrombosis except for the\nadministration of MPA, we concluded that superior sagital sinus thrombosis was\ndue to the medication of MPA. This case illustrates that forensic pathologist\nshould consider the major side effect of some drugs like our case.\n\nPMID: 9545761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In both dogs,\nbody sizes increased and a complete adult hair coat developed. Undesirable\nside-effects were recurrent periods of pruritic pyoderma in both dogs and cystic \nendometrial hyperplasia with mucometra in the female dog. Parallel with the\nphysical improvements, plasma insulin-like growth factor I concentrations rose\nsharply. Plasma GH concentrations tended to rise, but never exceeded the upper\nlimit of the reference range. Nevertheless, one of the dogs developed slight\nacromegalic features, possibly because mammary GH, unlike pituitary GH, is\nreleased evenly throughout the day. Even moderate increases in circulating GH\nconcentration may, therefore, give rise to overexposure. It is concluded that\nlong-term treatment with MPA can be used as an alternative for heterologous GH in\nthe treatment of congenital GH deficiency in the dog.\n\nPMID: 9532423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Contraception. 1997 Oct;56(4):241-4.\n\nThe contraceptive choice for a Wilson's disease patient with chronic liver\ndisease.\n\nHaimov-Kochman R(1), Ackerman Z, Anteby EY.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hadassah University Hospital-Mount\nScopus, Jerusalem, Israel.\n\nPreserved fertility status is frequently encountered in patients with Wilson's\ndisease, and contraceptive counseling may, therefore, be a relevant issue. Yet,\nseveral contraceptive methods can adversely influence the hepatic function, and\nthe efficacy of others may be affected by the liver disease. We describe a\npatient with Wilson's disease manifested by cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and\nbleeding esophageal varices who underwent termination of pregnancy at 9 weeks'\ngestation. Following the procedure, contraceptive advice was sought in order to\npostpone conception until portal hypertension was controlled and hepatic function\nimproved. Intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was administered and\ntolerated well by the patient. A detailed discussion of the contraceptive options\nfor patients with chronic liver disease, in general, and Wilson's disease, in\nparticular, follows the case report.\n\nPIP: Although the fertility status of women with Wilson's disease may be\npreserved, contraceptive method choice is complicated by the tendency for some\nmethods to have an adverse effect on hepatic function and, conversely, for liver \ndisease to compromise the efficacy of some contraceptives. This paper presents\nthe case of a 28-year-old woman diagnosed with Wilson's disease at 13 years of\nage. She presented to an Israeli hospital at 9 weeks' gestational age with\nbleeding esophageal varices, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. Although the\npatient had been oligomenorrheic, with menses every 2-3 months, she had\nexperienced 3 spontaneous first-trimester abortions. Due to the urgent need for a\nportal decompression shunt procedure and the risk of further bleeding, the\npatient opted to terminate the current pregnancy. To prevent conception until the\npatient's liver condition stabilized, she was injected with Depo-Provera and\npenicillamine treatment was resumed. Although IUDs and estrogen-containing oral\ncontraceptives are relatively contraindicated in women with liver dysfunction,\nspermicide and barrier contraceptives are highly recommended and\nprogesterone-only preparations can be safely prescribed.\nPMID: 9408705  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Studies of the toxicity of\nMedroxyprogesterone Acetate list the commonest adverse events at 500 mg/day as\nweight gain, water retention, increased blood pressure, tremor, moon face,\nsweating, muscle cramps, vaginal bleeding and increased appetite.\nGlucocorticoid-like effects are seen in up to 30% of patients treated for longer \nthan 6 weeks with mostly large doses of the order of 1500 mg/day but Cushing's\nsyndrome has been reported in patients taking 400 mg/day. Neither the\nglucocorticoid-like effects or Cushing's syndrome have been previously observed\nwith Megestrol Acetate. In the elderly female population receiving progestogens\nfor neoplastic disease the progestogen itself could be an appreciable cause of\nmorbidity both by causing glucocorticoid-like effects and Cushing's syndrome but \nalso by lack of awareness of the danger of sudden withdrawal of these compounds\nwhen the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is suppressed. The signs and\nsymptoms could be easily overlooked unless appropriate testing for Cushing's\nsyndrome is carried out. While the progestogen may have to be continued\nindefinitely a dose decrease may be feasible with reduction of morbidity.\n\nPMID: 8522428  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Five of the 7 patients were cases who had responded well\nto short-term ERT with 1.25 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) for 6\nweeks. The 7 patients from 56 to 77 years of age received 0.625 mg/day of CEE for\n21 days, followed by a pause of 7 days. A 28-day cycle of low-dose ERT was\nperformed repeatedly. In 4 cases, these patients received 5 mg/day of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) during the last 10-12 days of estrogen\ntreatment. Therapeutic efficacy of estrogen was evaluated by psychometric\nassessments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Hasegawa\nDementia Scale (HDS) and a behavior rating scale of the Gottfries-Br\xc3\xa5ne-Steen\ngeriatric rating scale (GBS). The MMSE and HDS evaluations were performed\nprincipally once in 2-4 weeks. In 4 out of the 7 patients, the MMSE and HDS\nscores were elevated above the pretreatment levels during ERT. The termination of\nERT resulted in a decrease in both scores. Furthermore, the GBS scores and daily \nactivities of the same 4 patients were improved during ERT. In these 4 patients\ncognitive functions were markedly improved throughout the treatment period, while\nthe other 2 patients responded moderately well and another patient did not\nrespond at all. These observations suggest that long-term, low-dose ERT improves \ncognitive functions, dementia symptoms and daily activities in women with mild to\nmoderate DAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 7606287  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Mild and diffuse\nencephalopathies were noted through EEG recordings. No definite epileptiform\nabnormalities or focal supratentorial lesions were seen and the pattern was\nconsistent with patients with post-encephalitis. Treatment of this patient\ninvolved the use of anti-androgen and antianxiety pharmacotherapy along with\ncounseling to provide basic sex education and specific education for socially\naccepted sexual behavior. Follow-up evaluation several yrs later indicated good\ntreatment results. This case illustrates potential sources of sexually deviant\nbehavior and treatment options.

The authors report two cases of STB with pulmonary involvement\noccurring in the same family, mother and daughter. Both presented with typical\ncutaneous manifestations of the disease and bilateral renal angiomyolipomas. In\nthe daughter, the early pulmonary diagnosis was made by computed tomographic\nexamination (TDM) which showed the images of the cyst very sharply, although the \npulmonary radiograph was normal. Prolonged follow up with pulmonary function\ntests is important. Lung function tests were very abnormal in the mother with a\nfrank diminution of the TLCO and hypoxia at rest. In the daughter, they revealed \nthe development of obstructive airways disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage was\ncarried out in both the mother and daughter and showed intra-alveolar haemorrhage\n(with a ground glass appearance on computed tomography in the mother). Pulmonary \nlymphangiomyomatosis (LPM) and STB with pulmonary involvement are clinical\ndisorders which are anatomically closely related. If the value of hormonal\ntreatment has been shown during the course of LMP, their efficacy in STB is\nvariable.\n\nPMID: 8235029  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The\npatient had been treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for 8 months. The\nincrease in FRC was obtained by applying a constant negative extrathoracic\npressure (NEP) with a poncho-type respirator. With pulmonary inflation, there was\na dramatic decrease in the apnea index and the percent apnea time, and an\nimprovement in sleep architecture. At all sleep stages, the desaturation duration\nwas shorter with NEP. The exact mechanisms by which pulmonary expansion improved \nsleep apnea in this patient remain unclear; lung volume dependence of upper\nairway patency and the improvements in apnea-induced desaturation may be\ncontributing factors. Our observation illustrates that lung volumes may be an\nimportant factor in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea, especially in\nthe apnea onset and in the apneic-induced desaturation.\n\nPMID: 2974620  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Her vision improved after treatment with vitamin B1 and other drugs.\nBut optic atrophy of the right eye and papilledema of the left eye remained. In\nJuly 1985, after an injection with Depo-Provera, her vision again worsened. The\nwoman received no more Depo-Provera after this time. In early 1987, she was\nreferred to Beijing's Tong Ren Hospital, where she was diagnosed as having\nbilateral ischemic papillopathy and optic atrophy. There have been few documented\ncases in medical literature of ocular complications related to use of\ncontraceptives. In 1981, Petursson et al. reported a case of macula edema\nresulting from oral contraceptives. In animal studies, oral contraceptives have\nbeen linked to papilledema and retinal vein obstruction. The case reported here\nis the 1st to link use of Depo- Provera with ocular complications.\nPMID: 2975585  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Weight, pulmonary function, arterial blood gases, minute\nventilation to carbon dioxide production ratio (VE/VCO2), and the ventilatory\nresponse to exercise (delta VE/delta VCO2) were normal. Episodes of obstructive\napnea (4 per hour during non-REM (NREM) and 10 per hour during REM) and oxygen\ndesaturation (9 per hour during NREM and 11 per hour during REM) were common\nduring sleep. Oxygen saturation ranged between 72 and 99% and 70 and 97% during\nNREM and REM sleep, respectively. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy for 4\nwk caused a reduction in awake PaCO2 (38 to 33 mm Hg), and an increase in VE/VCO2\n(17%), mouth occlusion pressure (50%), and AVE/VCO2 (23%). During sleep, apneas\nwere completely eliminated and only one episode of oxygen desaturation occurred. \nL-thyroxine therapy for 2 months after a placebo period caused an awake isocapnic\nhyperpnea with no change in PaCO2 and VE/VCO2 despite a 23% increase in VE. Mouth\nocclusion pressure increased 37% but delta VE/delta VCO2 was unchanged.\nObstructive apnea and oxygen desaturation during sleep were completely eliminated\nwith L-thyroxine. The patient noted completed relief of symptoms with both MPA\nand L-thyroxine. We concluded that the sleep apnea syndrome was the presenting\nmanifestation of hypothyroidism in this patient and was solely responsible for\nhis symptoms and disability.\n\nPMID: 6792957  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This work\npresents an evaluation of the usefulness of ultrasound examination of the pelvis \nin females with aberrant sexual development. Girls with these problems often need\nmultiple pelvic examinations to monitor their uterine response to hormone\ntherapy. Thirty-two patients with a variety of abnormalities including Mullerian \nagenesis and hypothalamic hypogonadism as well as patients with abnormal\nkaryotype commonly associated with gonadal dysgenesis and male\npseudohermaphrodism were studied. Repeat ultrasound scans were performed to\nquantitate uterine response to therapy. Ovarian visualization was usually\npossible, even in prepuberal girls. Following some patients at risk for gonadal\ntumors may be possible using repeat ultrasound examinations. The cooperation of\nthe patients as well as of their families was gratifying, and the girls appeared \nto be more relaxed during ultrasound examination than during a pelvic\nexamination.\n\nPMID: 6277836  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient, a\n40-year old Chinese woman had smoked 30 cigarettes daily for many years. She\nreceived injections of 150 mg Depo-Provera in April and July 1979. 2 days after\nthe 2nd injection she was admitted to the hospital for vomiting and vertigo of 2 \ndays duration. Clinical examination showed a 12th nerve palsy with the tongue\ndeviated to the right but no other neurological abnormalities. She was treated\nsymptomatically with intravenous fluids and stemetil and improved. On the 5th day\nher vertigo and vomiting progressed and she developed more lower brain stem\nsigns. The same day she had a grand mal fit and went into a coma. She died on the\n7th hospital day. A partial autopsy limited to the skull revealed minimal\natherosclerosis of the vertebral artery but no thrombosis or occlusion. Cut\nsections after perfusion revealed an area of softening associated with some\nhemorrhage involving the whole length of the right half of the medulla oblongata \ndorsal to the olivary nucleus. Histological examination revealed an infarct\nundergoing liquefaction necrosis. The possibility of a causative relationship is \nsuggested by the development of tinnitis about 12 hours after injection of\nDepo-Provera.\nPMID: 6452693  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin.

Blasts disappeared from\nthe peripheral blood but persisted at a level of 60% in the bone marrow. After 5 \nweeks of continuous therapy, the patient became thrombopenic, and 2 weeks later\nblasts rose to 31%. After 7 weeks, 1 g MPA was given daily p.o. and weekly\nvincristine treatment was resumed. Blasts disappeared again from the peripheral\nblood, thrombocytes rose to a maximum of 274 g/l, and a remission with less than \n5% blasts was demonstrated in the bone marrow. In another relapse after\nwithdrawal of MPA, estrogen and progesterone receptors (PR) were found in the\nleukemic cells. Thus, a remission was seen during treatment with vincristine,\nprednisone, and MPA after a deterioration with vincristine and prednisone alone\nin a PR-positive leukemia, and an effect of MPA in this lymphoid blast crisis of \na CML has to be discussed.\n\nPMID: 8148420  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A\n61-year-old woman visited our hospital due to an abnormal chest shadow. Computed \ntomograhy showed a mass that was composed of a cystic and solid lesion, in the\nright lower lobe. She had undergone a combination of a hysterectomy and\nadnexectomy for a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma 57 months previously, and\nundergone adjuvant radiation therapy at the local site. To obtain a definitive\ndiagnosis of the lung tumor, we performed lobectomy of the right lower lobe and\nlymph node dissection. To avoid possible dissemination, the tumor was resected\nnot using video-assisted thoracic surgery but using thoracotomy. The pathologic\ndiagnosis was pulmonary metastasis of the low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. \nNow, medroxyprogesterone acetate is being administered, and no signs of\nrecurrence have been detected in the 24 months since the lung resection.\n\nPMID: 24318286  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Objective responses\nby hormonal treatment with progestin or aromatase inhibitor have been reported,\nhowever, long-term management of this disease could be difficult if it becomes\nrefractory to one of these hormonal therapies. A 34-year-old woman was diagnosed \nwith stage I low-grade ESS at the time of hysterectomy for presumed uterine\nfibroma. Five years later, she recurred with multiple tumors in the lower\nabdomen. After an optimal surgery, she was free from progression for 6\xc2\xa0years with\nprogestin treatment (medroxyprogesterone acetate: MPA, 200-600\xc2\xa0mg daily).\nThereafter, she recurred twice during the MPA treatment and received debulking\nsurgery each time. MPA was discontinued at age of 53, because another recurrent\ntumor grew up to 13\xc2\xa0cm in diameter. Aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was then\ngiven at a daily dose of 1\xc2\xa0mg with partial response (the tumor size decreased to \n7\xc2\xa0cm in diameter) for a duration of 9\xc2\xa0months. After complete resection of the\nrecurrent tumor, she remains progression-free for 16\xc2\xa0months. Anastrozole was\neffective to recurrent low-grade ESS even after being refractory to progestin\ntherapy.

It accounts for 0.5% of all\nuterine corpus malignant tumors and 10% of all malignant non-epithelial tumors.\nMPA is one effective hormonal treatment for ESS. We describe two cases in which\npatients with metastatic low-grade ESS lesions had prolonged survival with MPA\ntherapy. Case 1 was a 50-year-old woman with a low-grade uterine endometrial\nstromal tumor who had been operated on at another hospital. She had been followed\nfor three years. She had pelvis metastases with infiltration into the bladder,\nand pulmonary metastases. She had an incomplete response to chemotherapy. We\ninitiated MPA therapy, which resulted in significant improvement in her\nmetastatic lesions. Case 2 was a 58-year-old woman with stage Ic low-grade ESS\nwho presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. Following surgery (TAH+BSO), MPA\ntherapy was initiated and she had no recurrence. After 1 year and 7 months, she\ndiscontinued the MPA because it worsened her articular rheumatism. Her cancer\nrecurred with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis. She was treated with\nchemotherapy, MPA and radiotherapy. Her metastases improved, and the patient has \ncontinued to survive on MPA therapy alone. These cases suggest that MPA might be \nan effective hormonal therapy for patients with low-grade ESS.\n\nPMID: 18487930  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin.

A 31-year-old infertile woman, diagnosed as FIGO stage Ia\nendometrial adenocarcinoma (grade 1), received oral medroxyprogesterone acetate\n400 mg/day for 12 weeks. Endometrial curettage was performed and the absence of\nendometrial carcinoma was confirmed. A single pregnancy was achieved with in\nvitro fertilization and embryo transfer.

However, it\nis not known for certain whether the lesion is completely eradicated in such\npatients. We present a case of residual endometrial carcinoma after term\npregnancy which had been treated conservatively before the pregnancy began.\nCASE: A 28-year-old woman with endometrial carcinoma received conservative\ntreatment with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and then conceived.\nAfter delivery at term, atypical cells were found in the endometrial curettage\nspecimen. A hysterectomy was performed 6 months after delivery and revealed the\npresence of a small focus of intramucosal, grade 1, endometrioid-type\nadenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for estrogen\nand progesterone receptors.\nCONCLUSION: We concluded that while MPA treatment had been effective, it had not \ncompletely eradicated the carcinomatous lesion, which remained during and after\nthe term pregnancy.\n\nCopyright 2000 Academic Press.\n\nPMID: 11006045  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Continuous combined HRT using 2.5 mg of\nmedroxyprogesterone was designed to increase patient compliance by eliminating\nwithdrawal bleeding while at the same time retaining the beneficial effects of\nHRT. There are limited long-term data, however, regarding the safety of\ncontinuous combined HRT. Of concern are reports of endometrial carcinoma arising \nin women receiving continuous HRT with low-dose progestin. Eight cases of women\nwho developed endometrial carcinoma while on this regimen are presented. The\npossible increased risk of endometrial cancer associated with this regimen may be\nrelated to inadequate progestin dose, prior use of unopposed estrogen, poor\npatient compliance, use of less effective progestins, less efficient reversal of \nhyperplasia, and the use of progestin continuously.\n\nPMID: 9062144  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

But in poor cases, like renal failure and such, it is\ndifficult to perform the therapy. Two cases of recurrent uterine endometrial\ncancer treated earlier with MPA were presently treated with an addition of\netoposide. The first case was given etoposide (50 mg/m2/day 4 times for 21 days\nby oral administration). The target tumor mass was reduced in size, occult blood \nvanished, and the tumor marker was reduced. The other case was treated with\netoposide, 50 mg/body/day for 21 days by oral administration, but because of\ndiarrhea, the dose had to be decreased to 25 mg/body/day every day. The tumor\nmarker was reduced and genital bleeding vanished.

The patient had a medical history\nincluding chronic stable hepatitis C infection. At diagnosis there was a severe\nanemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, IgG paraproteinemia, peripheral blood\nmyeloma cells, and a marrow plasmacytosis with lytic bony lesion. The disease was\nrefractory to standard chemotherapy, and she was treated with oral thalidomide.\nWithin 1 week she became jaundiced and developed a marked transaminitis. This\npromptly resolved upon cessation of thalidomide alone. Thalidomide has recently\nenjoyed renewed interest as a treatment in many disorders, including plasma cell \nleukemia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of\nthalidomide-associated hepatotoxicity. Although the mechanism of its actions on\nthe liver are uncertain, it is possible that thalidomide acts as a direct\nhepatotoxin or as an immuno-modulator, altering the activity of chronic viral\nhepatitis. We present this case to increase awareness of a new potential side\neffect of thalidomide as its clinical indications expand.\n\nCopyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nPMID: 11279644  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A\n61-year-old woman visited our hospital due to an abnormal chest shadow. Computed \ntomograhy showed a mass that was composed of a cystic and solid lesion, in the\nright lower lobe. She had undergone a combination of a hysterectomy and\nadnexectomy for a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma 57 months previously, and\nundergone adjuvant radiation therapy at the local site. To obtain a definitive\ndiagnosis of the lung tumor, we performed lobectomy of the right lower lobe and\nlymph node dissection. To avoid possible dissemination, the tumor was resected\nnot using video-assisted thoracic surgery but using thoracotomy. The pathologic\ndiagnosis was pulmonary metastasis of the low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. \nNow, medroxyprogesterone acetate is being administered, and no signs of\nrecurrence have been detected in the 24 months since the lung resection.\n\nPMID: 24318286  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, breast \ncancer frequently metastasizes to the sternum as solitary metastasis. Resection\nof the sternum was reported to be an effective surgical technique for sternum\nmetastasis which could not be remarkably improved by chemo-endocrine therapy and \nlocoregional recurrent breast cancer invading the skin. A first patient was\ndiagnosed with sternum metastasis invading the skin 44 months after radical\nmastectomy for breast cancer of stage II. A second patient had breast cancer of\nstage IV simultaneously with metastases to the sternum and the lung. Only the\nlung metastasis was successfully controlled by chemo-endocrine therapy, but the\nsternum metastasis was progressive, following radical mastectomy. Both patients\nmanifested solitary bone metastases and underwent full-thickness chest wall\nresection. The defect of the chest wall was reconstructed with the mucocutaneous \nflap using the dorsal latissimus muscle in case 1 and with the abdominal rectus\nmuscle in case 2. Twenty months after the resection of the sternum, the first\npatient suffered from supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, and the\nmultidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy was indicated. This\ntherapeutic procedure was effective, and the patient survived for 63 months after\nresection of the sternum. The second patient has made good progress for six\nmonths in maintaining complete remission with chemo-endocrine therapy. These\nfindings suggested that surgical resection was a useful local treatment for\nsolitary sternum metastasis.\n\nPMID: 9703824  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 49-year-old woman suffering from metastatic lung\ncarcinoma from breast carcinoma was administered MPA 1200 mg/day for about four\nmonths. Thereafter she complained of dizziness about two weeks but the general\npractitioners could detect no abnormality on physical examinations and on brain\nCT X-ray findings. Six days later, she died suddenly at her home. Forensic\nautopsy findings revealed the marked superior sagital sinus thrombosis and the\nmalignant lymphadenomatosis caused by metastatic lung carcinoma. As the patient\nhad not disease or trauma causing dural sinus thrombosis except for the\nadministration of MPA, we concluded that superior sagital sinus thrombosis was\ndue to the medication of MPA.

After 3 months of this treatment, metastatic lesions in the lung\nand pleura had disappeared. After 37 months, complete remission (CR) was\nevaluated in the multiple lesions of bone metastasis. She achieved a complete\nremission (CR) by this treatment lymph nodes metastasis in both mediastinum after\n24 months and unilateral axillae after 15 months. Complete response time was 38\nmonths in both lung and pleura, 15 months in bone metastasis, 15 months in\nmediastinal lymph nodes, 24 months in unilateral ones. Normalization of tumor\nmarkers was acquired after 7 months of this hormonal therapy. This CR condition\ncontinues at present without severe complications.\n\nPMID: 8678522  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Surg Today. 1996;26(2):138-41.\n\nThe effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone in the treatment of multiple\nmetastasizing leiomyosarcomas: report of a case.\n\nUchida T(1), Nakakawaji K, Sakamoto J, Kojima H, Murakami H, Kato J, Yasue M.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Surgery, Aichi Prefectural Hospital, Kakemachi, Okazaki, Japan.\n\nA 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for further investigation of\nchest X-ray films which showed multiple shadows that had been growing slowly over\n2 years. Her only symptom was hemosputa. The lesions were suspected of being\nmetastasizing leiomyoma due to her past history of uterine leiomyoma. Just 1 week\nbefore undergoing scheduled open lung biopsy, the lung lesions increased\nremarkably in size and number. A thoracotomy was performed and six of the\nnumerous nodules were removed. The resected specimens were pathologically\ndiagnosed as metastasizing leimyosarcoma which was positive for the progesterone \nand estrogen receptors. Thus, 1 month postoperatively, a course of\nmedroxyprogesterone (MPA), 600 mg daily, was commenced. The residual lesions in\nher chest started to diminish, shortly afterward. She has remained well on this\nMPA regimen for 45 months. The prognosis of patients with metastasizing\nleiomyosarcoma is poor because of its low sensitivity to chemotherapy; however,\nsome types of leiomyosarcoma are hormone-sensitive. It is therefore important to \nexamine the hormone receptors of excised tumors from patients suspected of having\nmetastasizing leiomyoma or leimyosarcoma.\n\nPMID: 8919287  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We herein report a case of a 62-year-old woman who underwent\nsurgery for recurrent chylothorax. Histologic examination of lung and lymph node \nbiopsies demonstrated lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Thirty-six months after\ntetracycline pleurodesis and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy, the\ndisease was stable and cyclothorax effectively controlled.

Complete\nresponse was obtained by combined chemoendocrine therapy with 5'-DFUR and MPA.\nThe patient was a 62-year-old female. She underwent a standard radical mastectomy\nin April, 1988. The primary legion was ER (-) and PgR (-). Postoperative\ntreatments using CMF and CAF were eventually discontinued owing to profound\ndamage to the bone marrow. An adjuvant chemotherapy with UFT has been employed\nsince. Two years and 7 months later, hemosputum and coughing appeared, and\nmetastases to the lung were revealed. Combined chemoendocrine therapy with\n5'-DFUR and MPA was undertaken. A significant decrease in tumor size was observed\n3 months after the chemoendocrine therapy was begun, and complete response was\nobtained at the 8th month. The state has been maintained for one year and 9\nmonths. The use of combined chemoendocrine therapy with 5'-DFUR and MPA in\npatients for whom intensive chemotherapy is not possible due to damage to bone\nmarrow function is considered effective for its antitumor effects or maintaining \npatients' quality of life.\n\nPMID: 7979428  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

On admission, \na left inguinal tumor was found and histologically it consisted of smooth muscle \ncells with nuclear atypia arranged in interlacing fascicles. An open-lung biopsy \nwas performed. Pulmonary tumors revealed similar histology to the inguinal tumor.\nThey were diagnosed as metastatic low-grade leiomyosarcoma, so-called benign\nmetastasizing leiomyoma (BML), on the basis of location and history, reinforced\nby mild histologic atypia. The tumor contained a high progesterone receptor level\n(400 fmol/mg). Therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate, 600 mg daily, was\nadministered orally.

It results from a tumorlike\nproliferation of smooth muscle in the thoracic and retroperitoneal lymphatics.\nProminent clinical findings are dyspnea, spontaneous pneumothorax, chylous\npleural effusions and chylous ascites. The diagnosis results from typical chest\nX-rays and is established by open lung biopsy. Treatment should primarily start\nwith medroxyprogesteronacetat (respectively tamoxifen), if necessary with\nconsideration of the hormonal receptors. In an early stage the oophorectomy can\nbe helpful. Surgical intervention is necessary in complications (thoracic\ndrainage, pleurectomy for recurrent pneumothorax, Le Veen-shunt for chylous\nascites). If hormonal therapy is not successful, a combined heart and lung\ntransplantation should be attempted in ultima ratio.\n\nPMID: 2140768  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It accounts for 0.5% of all\nuterine corpus malignant tumors and 10% of all malignant non-epithelial tumors.\nMPA is one effective hormonal treatment for ESS. We describe two cases in which\npatients with metastatic low-grade ESS lesions had prolonged survival with MPA\ntherapy. Case 1 was a 50-year-old woman with a low-grade uterine endometrial\nstromal tumor who had been operated on at another hospital. She had been followed\nfor three years. She had pelvis metastases with infiltration into the bladder,\nand pulmonary metastases. She had an incomplete response to chemotherapy. We\ninitiated MPA therapy, which resulted in significant improvement in her\nmetastatic lesions. Case 2 was a 58-year-old woman with stage Ic low-grade ESS\nwho presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. Following surgery (TAH+BSO), MPA\ntherapy was initiated and she had no recurrence. After 1 year and 7 months, she\ndiscontinued the MPA because it worsened her articular rheumatism. Her cancer\nrecurred with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis. She was treated with\nchemotherapy, MPA and radiotherapy. Her metastases improved, and the patient has \ncontinued to survive on MPA therapy alone. These cases suggest that MPA might be \nan effective hormonal therapy for patients with low-grade ESS.\n\nPMID: 18487930  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, breast \ncancer frequently metastasizes to the sternum as solitary metastasis. Resection\nof the sternum was reported to be an effective surgical technique for sternum\nmetastasis which could not be remarkably improved by chemo-endocrine therapy and \nlocoregional recurrent breast cancer invading the skin. A first patient was\ndiagnosed with sternum metastasis invading the skin 44 months after radical\nmastectomy for breast cancer of stage II. A second patient had breast cancer of\nstage IV simultaneously with metastases to the sternum and the lung. Only the\nlung metastasis was successfully controlled by chemo-endocrine therapy, but the\nsternum metastasis was progressive, following radical mastectomy. Both patients\nmanifested solitary bone metastases and underwent full-thickness chest wall\nresection. The defect of the chest wall was reconstructed with the mucocutaneous \nflap using the dorsal latissimus muscle in case 1 and with the abdominal rectus\nmuscle in case 2. Twenty months after the resection of the sternum, the first\npatient suffered from supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, and the\nmultidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy was indicated. This\ntherapeutic procedure was effective, and the patient survived for 63 months after\nresection of the sternum. The second patient has made good progress for six\nmonths in maintaining complete remission with chemo-endocrine therapy. These\nfindings suggested that surgical resection was a useful local treatment for\nsolitary sternum metastasis.\n\nPMID: 9703824  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There was a large ulcer from her left anterior chest to her right side \nchest. After pathological examination from the ulcer, she was diagnosed as breast\ncancer, scirrhous carcinoma. The estrogen and progesterone receptors were\npositive in the tumor. HER2 score was 1+ in the tumor. The stage was\nT4bNxM1(OTH). Uterine metastases of the breast cancer caused obstructive\nnephropathy. Ureteral obstruction was treated by urinary tract catheter. After\nimprovement of renal failure, chemotherapy with 5-FU+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide \n(FEC) and docetaxel was performed. The efficacy was judged as stable disease\n(SD). For third-line chemotherapy, she was then treated with oral combination\nchemoendocrine therapy with capecitabine and medroxyprogesterone acetate. After\nthe combination chemoendocrine therapy, the local tumor was remarkably reduced.\nWith added cyclophosphamide, the partial response (PR) continued for 19 months.\nShe died of peritonitis carcinomatosa and pleuritis carcinomatosa. No adverse\nreactions occurred with the combination chemoendocrine therapy.

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women.

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin. Recurrent AEH had undergone malignant transformation,\nresulting in the development of well- and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma\nand tumor exhibiting germ-cell-like differentiation. The patient died of a\nmassive tumor extension 7 months after surgery.

The patient who had recurrent breast\ncancer with multiple lung metastases was treated with a combination of docetaxel \n(TXT) 80 mg/body three cycles, two courses of 40 mg/body four times and\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 600 mg p.o. daily. Six months later, the lung\nmetastases had completely disappeared on chest CT-scan. Complete remission has\nbeen maintained for one and half years. The use of combined chemoendocrine\ntherapy with TXT and MPA is considered effective for recurrent breast cancer as\nsecond-line therapy.\n\nPMID: 12894715  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status of the primary\ntumor was unknown. Ten years after the surgery, a metastatic liver tumor was\ndetected, and chemoendocrine therapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin,\n5-fluorouracil (CEF) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) was initiated. The\nmetastatic liver tumor showed a partial response after 11 cycles of such\nchemoendocrine therapy. Subsequently, MPA alone was given daily as maintenance\ntherapy, and the disease has remained stable for 6 years. For women with\nmetastatic breast cancer, complete remission is uncommon, and stable disease is a\nreasonable goal of successful therapy.

As the lung metastases were increased four\nmonths later, carboplatin 150 mg i.v. was replaced with ADM. Four months later,\nthe metastases almost disappeared on CT gram. These results suggested the\npossibility of one of the therapeutic options for metastatic breast cancer.\n\nPMID: 7887649  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

But in poor cases, like renal failure and such, it is\ndifficult to perform the therapy. Two cases of recurrent uterine endometrial\ncancer treated earlier with MPA were presently treated with an addition of\netoposide. The first case was given etoposide (50 mg/m2/day 4 times for 21 days\nby oral administration). The target tumor mass was reduced in size, occult blood \nvanished, and the tumor marker was reduced. The other case was treated with\netoposide, 50 mg/body/day for 21 days by oral administration, but because of\ndiarrhea, the dose had to be decreased to 25 mg/body/day every day. The tumor\nmarker was reduced and genital bleeding vanished. These cases suggested that\netoposide-MPA combined therapy might be effective for recurrent uterine\nendometrial cancer of well-differentiated type.\n\nPMID: 7826070  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The radioenhancing effect is not\nlimited to the lungs, since radioesofagitis was also encountered in similarly\ntreated patients.\n\nPMID: 2994878  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is\nsuggested that special attention be paid to liver function during simultaneous\nMPA and tamoxifen administration; in case of adverse liver reaction during the\ncombined treatment, a formula of sequential administration of the drugs could be \nimplemented.\n\nPMID: 6235770  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

An immune-mediated disorder, \nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, was diagnosed when she was 15 years\nold. Clinical examination and laboratory findings revealed a PGA syndrome due to \nthe presence of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, insufficient growth hormone\nresponse and thyroid autoimmunity. The patient had neither adrenal disease nor\nhypoparathyroidism. Therefore we concluded that this patient has PGA syndrome\ntype III. This is an interesting case, because we could not find any previous\nreport of such coexistence between PGA type III and CVID in a Medline search.\nCoexistence of these two entities may be a result of autoimmunity and the\nassociation of both conditions with human leukocyte antigen.\n\nPMID: 15625773  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Califano, Italy.\n\nThe coexistence of autoimmune endocrine diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid\ndisease and celiac disease (CD), has recently been reported. We here present a\n23-year-old woman with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's\nthyroiditis, autoimmune Addison's disease, and kariotypically normal spontaneous \npremature ovarian failure. Considering the close association between autoimmune\ndiseases and CD, we decided to search for IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) in\nthe serum. The positivity of EmA and the presence of total villous atrophy at\njejunal biopsy allowed the diagnosis of CD. On a gluten-free diet the patient\nshowed a marked clinical improvement accompanied, over a 3-month period, by a\nprogressive decrease in the need for thyroid and adrenal replacement therapies.\nAfter 6 months, serum EmA became negative and after 12 months a new jejunal\nbiopsy showed complete mucosal recovery. After 18 months on gluten-free diet, the\nanti-thyroid antibodies titre decreased significantly, and we could discontinue\nthyroid substitutive therapy. This case emphasizes the association between\nautoimmune polyglandular disease and CD; the precocious identification of these\ncases is clinically relevant not only for the high risk of complications (e.g.\nlymphoma) inherent to untreated CD, but also because CD is one of the causes for \nthe failure of substitute hormonal therapy in patients with autoimmune thyroid\ndisease.\n\nPMID: 10401714  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The serum concentration of phenytoin was well \ncontrolled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later,\ncombination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100\nmg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further\nmetastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with\nthe antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to\nfourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but\ntoxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin\nconcentration after its withdrawal.\nDISCUSSION: A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin\nmetabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The\ninteraction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it\nis reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure\nof rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the\nlikeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of\nclinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum\nphenytoin concentration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentrations when phenytoin is given in combination with fluorouracil\nderivatives, including 5'-DFUR.\n\nPMID: 11978162  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

All published cases of PRCA induced by pregnancy\nwere reviewed. Additionally, we reported a patient who developed PRCA on three\noccasions; two were triggered by pregnancy and one after medroxyprogesterone\nadministration. Ten patients with 13 pregnancy-induced PRCA episodes were\nreported. The PRCA occurred at any gestational age. All patients received blood\ntransfusions, and six of them were treated corticosteroids. The PRCA resolved in \nall subjects postpartum. Five women had subsequent pregnancies; three were\ncomplicated by PRCA, one was normal, and one had spontaneous abortion without\nPRCA. One subject developed a PRCA after long-term exposure to\nmedroxyprogesterone. Infant blood values were normal in the nine reported cases. \nPregnancy-induced PRCA is a self-limited syndrome with a high risk for relapse\nduring subsequent pregnancies. It can be managed by blood transfusions.\nProgestins might cause PRCA in these women.\n\nPMID: 17262194  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Since menarche, she had suffered from severe\nmenorrhagia, but she had assumed that this was unrelated to her mother's history \nof repeated life-threatening bleeding. Her menorraghia was evident by using\ngreater than 100 pads per period, bleeding as long as 4 continuous months, and\neven bleeding through her clothes despite using both tampons and pads. Evaluation\nwith pelvic examination, endometrial biopsy, and pelvic ultrasound was\nunremarkable. Medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment for her dysfunctional uterine\nbleeding was unsuccessful. Laboratory evaluation revealed iron deficiency anemia \nbut otherwise normal platelets, bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated\npartial thromboplastin time, and vonWillebrand's studies. Despite any\npreconceptions, examination for a fibrinolytic defect ultimately demonstrated a\nPAI-1 antigen level of 11.4 ng/mL (4.0-43 ng/mL) and PAI-1 activity less than 5\nAU/mL (5-37 AU/mL) and clinically supported a diagnosis of a hereditary,\nqualitative PAI-1 defect. She was treated with aminocaproic acid with return to\nrelatively normal menses. Future treatment should also prevent excessive bleeding\nduring trauma, surgery, or childbirth. Further evaluation of this patient and her\nfamily is planned and may help elucidate the important role of PAI-1 in the\ncomplicated balance between hemostasis and hemorrhage.\n\nPMID: 15247991  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S"\n1. J Adolesc Health Care. 1983 Dec;4(4):257-60.\n\nChromosomally competent ovarian failure at adolescence.\n\nRauh JL, Waldrop CD, Burket RL.\n\nThree female adolescents are presented with delayed or incomplete secondary\nsexual development due to primary ovarian failure. All three patients had normal \nblood leukocyte and ovarian tissue karyotypes. The importance of performing a\ndiagnostic laparoscopy with ovarian biopsy in the setting of chromosome competent\novarian failure (CCOF) is emphasized.\n\nPIP: The cases are described of 3 female adolescents evaluated at the Cincinnati \nAdolescent Clinic for delayed or incomplete secondary sexual development due to\nprimary ovarian failure. All 3 patients had normal blood leukocyte and ovarian\ntissue karyotypes. The clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings are\ndiscussed with emphasis on distinguishing chromosome incompetent ovarian failure \n(CIOF-Turner's syndrome) from chromosome competent ovarian failure (CCOF). The\npatients included a 15 1/2 year old black female who sought evaluation of obesity\nand lethargy, a 17 1/2 year old white female with secondary amenorrhea in whom\noral provera failed to induce menstrual flow, and a 17 1/2 year old black female \nwith scanty, infrequent menses who achieved a normal amount and duration of\nmenstrual flow with Norinyl 1 + 80. Hypoestrogenization should be suspected in\ncases of incomplete breast development for age, thin vaginal mucosa with a\nprepubertal pattern of the vaginal cytology, scant cervical mucus without\nferning, and lack of withdrawal bleeding after progesterone administration. If\nany decrease in ovarian steroid production is clinically suspected in an\nadolescent with primary or secondary amenorrhea associated with delayed or\nincomplete puberty, serum gonadotropin levels should be measured. A single\nelevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the menopausal range is\ndiagnostic of primary ovarian failure in an adolescent. If the FSH is low or\nnormal, hypothalamic or pituitary disease would be suspected. A blood leukocyte\nkaryotype is the next diagnostic procedure for patients with primary ovarian\nfailure to distinguish between CCOF and CIOF. If the blood karyotype is XO or a\nvariant without a Y cell line, no further cytogenic workup or visualization of\nthe gonads is needed, but girls with blood karyotype of XX or a mosaic pattern\nwith 1 cell line with a Y chromosome should undergo laparoscopy and gonadal\nbiopsy. A unilateral testis should be removed to avoid malignant changes in later\nyears. Patients with CCOF may have other endocrine dysfunction, particularly\nautoimmune disease. Other possible diagnoses include resistant ovary syndrome,\npure gonadal dysgenesis, premature menopause, or infectious, chemical, or other\ncauses of ovarian failure. The incidence of CIOF is greater than that of CCOF\namong patients with primary ovarian failure. Optimal treatment requires medical\nand psychosocial intervention.\nPMID: 6315654  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Gynecologists are often\nconsulted before transplant for management of abnormal uterine bleeding, which\nmay be particularly challenging in this context.\nCASE: A premenopausal woman with MonoMAC (a rare adult-onset immunodeficiency\nsyndrome characterized by monocytopenia and Mycobacterium avium complex\ninfections resulting from mutations in GATA2, a crucial gene in early\nhematopoiesis) presented with pancytopenia, evolving leukemia, and recent\nstrokes, necessitating anticoagulation. During preparation for hematopoietic stem\ncell transplant, she experienced prolonged menorrhagia requiring transfusions.\nSurgical therapy was contraindicated, and medical management was successful only \nwhen combined with balloon tamponade.\nCONCLUSION: Balloon tamponade may be a potentially life-saving adjunct to medical\ntherapy for control of uterine hemorrhage before hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplant.\n\nPMCID: PMC3798064\nPMID: 23344397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Results are conflicting as to whether there is a link between \nthe two. We describe three patients who experienced cerebral embolism during HRT.\nA 73-year-old woman had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 6 years prior to the\npresent admission. She then took HRT oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate\nfor about 6 years. The HRT had been prescribed by a gynaecologist for\namelioration of postmenopausal symptoms. Six years after beginning HRT, she\nexperienced sudden onset left hemiparesis due to cerebral embolism. Two other\npatients had been taking HRT for breast cancers. One, a 47-year-old woman, had\ntaken medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than one year, for recurrence of\nbreast cancer. She had developed sudden complete left hemiparesis due to an\nembolism at the carotid bifurcation. The other patient, a 72-year-old woman who\nwas taking tamoxifen citrate for prevention of breast cancer relapse, experienced\ncerebral embolism just 2 months after beginning tamoxifen. The risk of cerebral\nembolism in those on HRT should be emphasized, along with the beneficial effects \nin terms of postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of breast cancer recurrence.\n\nPMID: 11422601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fertil Steril. 1999 Feb;71(2):373-5.\n\nA case of fatal pulmonary thromboembolism associated with the use of intravenous \nestrogen therapy.\n\nZreik TG(1), Odunsi K, Cass I, Olive DL, Sarrel P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New \nHaven, Connecticut 06520-8063, USA. tony.zreik@yale.edu\n\nOBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal pulmonary embolism associated with the use\nof i.v. estrogen therapy for menometrorrhagia.\nDESIGN: Case report.\nSETTING: University hospital.\nPATIENT(S): A 52-year-old woman with fibroid uterus treated with GnRH analogues\nwith add-back therapy who presented with excessive vaginal bleeding.\nINTERVENTION(S): Intravenous conjugated estrogens were administered for a total\nof six doses.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fatal thromboembolic event.\nRESULT(S): The day after i.v. conjugated estrogens were administered, the patient\nhad only scant vaginal bleeding, but she experienced the sudden onset of\nrespiratory distress, became comatose, and subsequently had ventricular\nfibrillation leading to asystole. All resuscitative efforts failed. Postmortem\nexamination revealed bilateral pulmonary artery thromboembolism (saddle embolus).\nCONCLUSION(S): Intravenous conjugated estrogen therapy may be complicated by\nfatal thromboembolic events. This potential adverse effect must be considered in \nthe use of such therapy for severe menometrorrhagia, especially when treating a\npatient at increased risk.\n\nPMID: 9988414  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient developed a lipoid\npneumonia with dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, radiographic infiltrates, and a pleural\neffusion. She was hospitalized for 4 days, and signs and symptoms resolved over 2\nweeks following steroids and supportive care.\nDISCUSSION: Experience with accidental or intentional intravenous lipid overdose \nin humans is limited. Typical findings of fat embolus syndrome are similar to\nlipid aspiration, with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltrates. \nIn contrast to aspiration, however, fat embolus syndrome results in\nlipogranulomas surrounding blood vessels, rather than air passages, and\npotentially produces cerebrovascular, accident-like symptoms. Management of fat\nembolus syndrome is similar to that for lipid aspiration. However, as seen in\nthis case, fat embolus syndrome typically resolves over several weeks as opposed \nto the 3-month to 1-year period seen with aspiration lipoid pneumonias.\nCONCLUSIONS: Accidental intravenous infusion of vegetable oil-based products is a\npotential complication of the increased use of intravenous progesterones.\n\nPMID: 9865244  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Since FDA approval\nfor contraceptive use in 1992, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)--already \nused by millions of women worldwide--has been used by several million U.S. women.\nAlthough women using this 3-month progestin-only injectable often experience\nirregular bleeding and spotting (initially), long-term DMPA use typically results\nin amenorrhea. Many users, including adolescents, choose DMPA because of its\nconvenience--nearly 100% contraceptive effectiveness is achieved with 4\ninjections per year. Because DMPA does not contain estrogen, it represents an\nappropriate contraceptive choice for postpartum or lactating women, as well as\nthose whose medical status precludes use of contraceptive doses of estrogen. Some\nexamples include: women over age 35 who smoke, those with increased\nthromboembolism risk, women with cardiovascular or liver disease, as well as\nwomen with complex migraines. Although fertility resumes on the average 10 months\nfollowing the last injection, suppression of ovulation occasionally persists for \nas long as 22 months. Consequently, DMPA is not an appropriate choice for women\nwho may wish to conceive within the next two years. Since the use of DMPA lowers \novarian estradiol production, reversible loss of bone mineral density (BMD) may\noccur. Studies currently in progress may clarify DMPA's long-term impact, if any,\non BMD. Therapeutic uses of DMPA include treatment of: dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia \n(including that associated with fibroid uterine tumors), endometriosis,\nendometrial hyperplasia, ovulatory pain, pain associated with ovarian adhesive\ndisease, premenstrual dysphoria and perimenopausal symptoms.\n\nPMID: 9609206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 49-year-old woman suffering from metastatic lung\ncarcinoma from breast carcinoma was administered MPA 1200 mg/day for about four\nmonths. Thereafter she complained of dizziness about two weeks but the general\npractitioners could detect no abnormality on physical examinations and on brain\nCT X-ray findings. Six days later, she died suddenly at her home. Forensic\nautopsy findings revealed the marked superior sagital sinus thrombosis and the\nmalignant lymphadenomatosis caused by metastatic lung carcinoma. As the patient\nhad not disease or trauma causing dural sinus thrombosis except for the\nadministration of MPA, we concluded that superior sagital sinus thrombosis was\ndue to the medication of MPA. This case illustrates that forensic pathologist\nshould consider the major side effect of some drugs like our case.\n\nPMID: 9545761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Tissue-type plasminogen activator\nwas injected into both coronary arteries, resulting in diminution of thrombus\nsize. Repeat coronary angiography on the next day disclosed no thrombus in either\nartery and no significant stenosis. Electrocardiographic and laboratory data\nindicated myocardial infarction.

After\nthe surgery, tamoxifen citrate (TAM) was orally administered in addition to\nvarious types of chemotherapy. Because the patient complained of nausea and\nweight loss, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) was orally administered instead of\nTAM. The patient complained of intense abdominal pain on the 35th day of\nadministration. Laparotomy was then performed for her acute abdominal problem.\nBecause necrosis from bleeding due to jejunal vein thrombosis was observed in the\njejunum for about 15 cm, resection of the jejunum was carried out. Histological\nobservation demonstrated thrombosis in the vein, and cellular infiltration around\nthe thrombosis. The postoperative prognosis has been favorable and the\npostoperative course is now being monitored at our clinic (2 months after\nsurgery). The patient has no complications such as diabetes mellitus or\nhypercholesterolemia. The thrombosis observed in the jejunal vein, which is a\nrare site for it on the 35th day of MPA administration was induced by MPA.

S"\n1. J Adolesc Health Care. 1983 Dec;4(4):257-60.\n\nChromosomally competent ovarian failure at adolescence.\n\nRauh JL, Waldrop CD, Burket RL.\n\nThree female adolescents are presented with delayed or incomplete secondary\nsexual development due to primary ovarian failure. All three patients had normal \nblood leukocyte and ovarian tissue karyotypes. The importance of performing a\ndiagnostic laparoscopy with ovarian biopsy in the setting of chromosome competent\novarian failure (CCOF) is emphasized.\n\nPIP: The cases are described of 3 female adolescents evaluated at the Cincinnati \nAdolescent Clinic for delayed or incomplete secondary sexual development due to\nprimary ovarian failure. All 3 patients had normal blood leukocyte and ovarian\ntissue karyotypes. The clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings are\ndiscussed with emphasis on distinguishing chromosome incompetent ovarian failure \n(CIOF-Turner's syndrome) from chromosome competent ovarian failure (CCOF). The\npatients included a 15 1/2 year old black female who sought evaluation of obesity\nand lethargy, a 17 1/2 year old white female with secondary amenorrhea in whom\noral provera failed to induce menstrual flow, and a 17 1/2 year old black female \nwith scanty, infrequent menses who achieved a normal amount and duration of\nmenstrual flow with Norinyl 1 + 80. Hypoestrogenization should be suspected in\ncases of incomplete breast development for age, thin vaginal mucosa with a\nprepubertal pattern of the vaginal cytology, scant cervical mucus without\nferning, and lack of withdrawal bleeding after progesterone administration. If\nany decrease in ovarian steroid production is clinically suspected in an\nadolescent with primary or secondary amenorrhea associated with delayed or\nincomplete puberty, serum gonadotropin levels should be measured. A single\nelevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the menopausal range is\ndiagnostic of primary ovarian failure in an adolescent. If the FSH is low or\nnormal, hypothalamic or pituitary disease would be suspected. A blood leukocyte\nkaryotype is the next diagnostic procedure for patients with primary ovarian\nfailure to distinguish between CCOF and CIOF. If the blood karyotype is XO or a\nvariant without a Y cell line, no further cytogenic workup or visualization of\nthe gonads is needed, but girls with blood karyotype of XX or a mosaic pattern\nwith 1 cell line with a Y chromosome should undergo laparoscopy and gonadal\nbiopsy. A unilateral testis should be removed to avoid malignant changes in later\nyears. Patients with CCOF may have other endocrine dysfunction, particularly\nautoimmune disease. Other possible diagnoses include resistant ovary syndrome,\npure gonadal dysgenesis, premature menopause, or infectious, chemical, or other\ncauses of ovarian failure. The incidence of CIOF is greater than that of CCOF\namong patients with primary ovarian failure. Optimal treatment requires medical\nand psychosocial intervention.\nPMID: 6315654  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The patient, a\n40-year old Chinese woman had smoked 30 cigarettes daily for many years. She\nreceived injections of 150 mg Depo-Provera in April and July 1979. 2 days after\nthe 2nd injection she was admitted to the hospital for vomiting and vertigo of 2 \ndays duration. Clinical examination showed a 12th nerve palsy with the tongue\ndeviated to the right but no other neurological abnormalities. She was treated\nsymptomatically with intravenous fluids and stemetil and improved. On the 5th day\nher vertigo and vomiting progressed and she developed more lower brain stem\nsigns. The same day she had a grand mal fit and went into a coma. She died on the\n7th hospital day. A partial autopsy limited to the skull revealed minimal\natherosclerosis of the vertebral artery but no thrombosis or occlusion. Cut\nsections after perfusion revealed an area of softening associated with some\nhemorrhage involving the whole length of the right half of the medulla oblongata \ndorsal to the olivary nucleus. Histological examination revealed an infarct\nundergoing liquefaction necrosis. The possibility of a causative relationship is \nsuggested by the development of tinnitis about 12 hours after injection of\nDepo-Provera.\nPMID: 6452693  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The slit-lamp examination showed a central corneal perforation of\n1mm in diameter, with no associated infection or inflammatory process. The\npatient had no history of trauma. It was decided to apply a patch of Tachosil(\xc2\xae) \nat the site of corneal perforation. After 36 hours of occlusion, a layer of\nfibrin covered the perforation, closing the defect. Successful healing of the\ncorneal perforation was observed in the follow-up, with no recurrences of the\nprocess.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tachosil(\xc2\xae) is collagen sponge with human fibrin and human thrombin \nused in cardiological and neurosurgical surgery for haemostasis and the occlusion\nof vessels and meninges. We present the first indication in ophthalmology of\nTachosil(\xc2\xae) as an effective alternative in the treatment of sterile non-traumatic\ncorneal perforations less than 1.5 mm in size.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 Sociedad Espa\xc3\xb1ola de Oftalmolog\xc3\xada.

Five of the 7 patients were cases who had responded well\nto short-term ERT with 1.25 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) for 6\nweeks. The 7 patients from 56 to 77 years of age received 0.625 mg/day of CEE for\n21 days, followed by a pause of 7 days. A 28-day cycle of low-dose ERT was\nperformed repeatedly. In 4 cases, these patients received 5 mg/day of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) during the last 10-12 days of estrogen\ntreatment. Therapeutic efficacy of estrogen was evaluated by psychometric\nassessments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Hasegawa\nDementia Scale (HDS) and a behavior rating scale of the Gottfries-Br\xc3\xa5ne-Steen\ngeriatric rating scale (GBS). The MMSE and HDS evaluations were performed\nprincipally once in 2-4 weeks. In 4 out of the 7 patients, the MMSE and HDS\nscores were elevated above the pretreatment levels during ERT. The termination of\nERT resulted in a decrease in both scores. Furthermore, the GBS scores and daily \nactivities of the same 4 patients were improved during ERT. In these 4 patients\ncognitive functions were markedly improved throughout the treatment period, while\nthe other 2 patients responded moderately well and another patient did not\nrespond at all. These observations suggest that long-term, low-dose ERT improves \ncognitive functions, dementia symptoms and daily activities in women with mild to\nmoderate DAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 7606287  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

NPT, laboratory\ntumescence, and sexual behaviors in the hospital environment were all decreased. \nTestosterone levels declined by 73% within 2 weeks of starting the drug and\nprolactin levels increased by 300% across the treatment period. The effects on\nNPT and laboratory arousal were still partially in evidence 2 months after the\ndrug had been stopped, although testosterone levels had returned to predrug\nlevels. Some differences between the NPT and daytime test data are discussed in\nterms of the probable importance of testosterone to erotic fantasy.

Apropos of a case].\n\n[Article in Spanish]\n\nCalzada-Sierra DJ(1), Ferm\xc3\xadn-Hern\xc3\xa1ndez E, Vasallo-Prieto R, G\xc3\xb3mez-Fern\xc3\xa1ndez L,\nSantana de la F\xc3\xa9 A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Centro Internacional de Restauraci\xc3\xb3n Neurol\xc3\xb3gica, CIREN, La Habana, Cuba.\ndanny@neuro.sld.cu\n\nINTRODUCTION: Cyclical sciatica due to implantation of endometrial tissue in the \nsciatic nerve in the region of the sciatic notch is a very unusual cause of\nsciatica. It occurs in women of childbearing age, as episodes of pain in the\ndistribution of the sciatic nerve, which present in a cyclic manner and coincide \nwith menstruation. If it is not treated, a sensomotor mononeuropathy of the\nsciatic nerve develops.\nCLINICAL CASE: The patient had complained of right-sided sciatic pain from the\nage of 36 years. Over the years a motor deficit had slowly and progressively\nappeared causing foot drop. The painful crises were related to her menstrual\nperiods. At the age of 44 years a pyramidal muscle syndrome was diagnosed and\ntreated surgically. This was followed by increase in the crises of sciatic pain. \nA year later, she started to have sciatic pain on the left side, which was\nsimilar to that of the right side. The clinical, imaging and electrophysiological\nfindings are reported. The patient improved. She is still being treated with\ndepot medroxyprogesterone and her pain has disappeared.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cyclical sciatica due to endometriosis is little known and may lead \nto permanent disability. Computerized axial tomography of the pelvis using\ncontrast material is very useful for diagnosis. The use of depot\nmedroxyprogesterone seems to be a satisfactory treatment in some patients.\n\nPMID: 10528307  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There was a large ulcer from her left anterior chest to her right side \nchest. After pathological examination from the ulcer, she was diagnosed as breast\ncancer, scirrhous carcinoma. The estrogen and progesterone receptors were\npositive in the tumor. HER2 score was 1+ in the tumor. The stage was\nT4bNxM1(OTH). Uterine metastases of the breast cancer caused obstructive\nnephropathy. Ureteral obstruction was treated by urinary tract catheter. After\nimprovement of renal failure, chemotherapy with 5-FU+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide \n(FEC) and docetaxel was performed. The efficacy was judged as stable disease\n(SD). For third-line chemotherapy, she was then treated with oral combination\nchemoendocrine therapy with capecitabine and medroxyprogesterone acetate. After\nthe combination chemoendocrine therapy, the local tumor was remarkably reduced.\nWith added cyclophosphamide, the partial response (PR) continued for 19 months.\nShe died of peritonitis carcinomatosa and pleuritis carcinomatosa. No adverse\nreactions occurred with the combination chemoendocrine therapy. It is suggested\nthat this oral combination chemoendocrine therapy may be useful with\nconsideration for treatment effectiveness and the quality of life of the patient.\n\nPMID: 19755825  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The tumor in the left breast was 5.0 cm in diameter with skin\nulcer, and it was diagnosed as breast cancer. Magnetic resonance (MR) image\nshowed multiple vertebral and spinal metastases from breast cancer. Chemotherapy,\nconsisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) was\ninitiated.

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin. Recurrent AEH had undergone malignant transformation,\nresulting in the development of well- and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma\nand tumor exhibiting germ-cell-like differentiation. The patient died of a\nmassive tumor extension 7 months after surgery. The AEH before MPA therapy and\nthe recurrent tumors had genetically different characteristics based on evidence \nof a loss of heterozygosity, detected at D8S1132 (chromosomal locus, 8q22.1) in\nthe latter but not in the former, by analysis of genetic alterations using\nmicrosatellite markers.\n\nPMID: 15144406  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Following regression of\nendometrial lesions, their infertility was treated by inducing ovulation. Intact \npregnancy was diagnosed 13 months and 11 months after completion of the MPA\ntreatment, respectively. One patient had a twin pregnancy and delivered two\ninfants at 35 weeks of gestational age. The other patient delivered a full-term\nbaby. They had no evidence of recurrence 60 months and 31 months after the\nconservative treatment, respectively. We believe this conservative treatment with\nprogestin may be safely performed for young patients with endometrial cancer who \nwish to preserve their fertility.\n\nPMID: 10843466  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 43-year-old Japanese woman\ndeveloped bone metastases 3 years after surgery. Subsequent radiotherapy and\nchemoendocrine therapy with CAF (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil)\nand tamoxifen all failed, and she could not sit up because of bone metastases.\nThe performance status (PS) on admission was grade 4. After admission, delirium\naccompanied with sensory and visual hallucination caused by intense anxiety\noccurred, and a continuous consultation by psychiatrists was necessary. MPA\ntreatment at the dose of 1200 mg/day alleviated the bone pain, thus improving her\nPS to grade 1. Her appetite also improved, while her mental state stabilized. A\nbone scintigram revealed an improvement of bone metastases, and the tumor markers\nalso returned to normal values. The patient thus showed a pronounced improvement \nin her QOL due to both MPA treatment and team medical care. The role of the\nmedical staff as well as the importance of their cooperation in achieving an\nimprovement in the QOL of cancer patients is also discussed.\n\nPMID: 9744415  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Eighty patients of\nrenal cell carcinoma were treated during the period. Of those patients 13 (10\nmales and 3 females) had pulmonary metastasis and their ages were between 52 and \n74 (average 61.6). The therapies we performed were surgical resection, cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, BRM (biological response modifier) therapy, hormone therapy and\nirradiation therapy. Four patients became tumor free by administration of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate, interferon-alpha, UFT (a compound combining tegafur \nand uracil) and surgical resection respectively. In 1 patient, administration of \nUFT resulted in partial remission. Cytotoxic chemotherapy using cisplatin,\nvinblastine and doxorubicin, and irradiation therapy were not effective. These\nfindings suggest that BRM therapy, UFT therapy and hormone therapy are effective \nin eliminating pulmonary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma, particularly in the \npatients with excellent performance status whose original lesions had been\nresected.\n\nPMID: 2148250  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A complete remission however, was achieved by \nlocal treatment, which included intrathoracic infusions of ADM and cis-platinum\nplus hepatic artery infusions of ADM and lipiodol, in addition to a systemic\ntreatment consisting of a modification of the FEMP regimen employing UFT, CPA,\nMMC, and PDN, to which were added the immunopotentiators OK-432 and MPA.

This diagnosis was\nconfirmed by hysterectomy. Cases such as the one presented here are extremely\nrare, since medroxyprogesterone is commonly used to cure endometrial cancer. It\nis possible, that the adenocarcinoma was not hormone dependent since the patient \nwas not yet menopausal, obese, or diabetic, and the dose of medroxyprogesterone\nused was insufficient to stop the evolution of the endometrial carcinoma. In the \npublished literature there are no cases similar to the one presented here. In\ncase of persistent metrorrhagia in patients treated with medroxyprogesterone\nacetate, an exploratory curettage is absolutely necessary.\nPMID: 7323568  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

On a smear taken from the vagina of a 73-year-old woman, cells\nconsistent with adenocarcinoma were detected even though the patient was\nasymptomatic. The specimen from endometrial curettage was normal on microscopic\nexamination. The patient was readmitted, 2 months after dilatation and curettage,\nwith a right pleural effusion. Examination of the pleural fluid revealed\nadenocarcinomatous cells. Laparotomy disclosed a primary carcinoma (stage IV) of \nthe left fallopian tube. Thiotepa (45 mg) was instilled into the chest cavity and\nmedroxyprogesterone (100 mg tid) and melphalan (6 mg/d for 4 days over 6 weeks)\nwere given.

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Gynecologists are often\nconsulted before transplant for management of abnormal uterine bleeding, which\nmay be particularly challenging in this context.\nCASE: A premenopausal woman with MonoMAC (a rare adult-onset immunodeficiency\nsyndrome characterized by monocytopenia and Mycobacterium avium complex\ninfections resulting from mutations in GATA2, a crucial gene in early\nhematopoiesis) presented with pancytopenia, evolving leukemia, and recent\nstrokes, necessitating anticoagulation.

Admission records\nwere used to identify subjects who received at least 100 mg daily of oral MPA.\nThe primary outcome of successful treatment was chart documentation of a\nsubstantial decline in IH, such that subjects could return to preadmission\nresidence. Data were collected to assess trends in dose, adverse effects, use of \nother symptom-modifying medications prior to MPA initiation, and successful\nreturn to preadmission placement. A trial serotoneric agent was used in 70% of\nsubjects prior to MPA initiation. Sixty percent of subjects failed a trial of an \nantipsychotic, while 40% did not have response to the use of both a serotonergic \nagent and an antipsychotic before MPA was initiated. The average daily dose of\nMPA was 300 mg (range 100-400 mg/day). No adverse effects were documented from\nphysician, nursing, or behavioral health rounding notes; however, adverse effects\nmay not have been systematically assessed at the time of MPA administration.\nSeventy percent of subjects experienced favorable changes in target behaviors\nfrom MPA.\nDISCUSSION: Few data exist on effective therapy options for treatment of IH. The \nminimum concentration of MPA needed to suppress IH in the male body is unknown.\nMPA was titrated upward, with the efficacy measure being a decrease in\ninappropriate behaviors. Use of MPA likely contributed to decreased IH; however, \nother factors involved in hospitalization could have contributed to improved\nbehavior.\nCONCLUSIONS: While requiring further study, high-dose (100-400 mg/day) oral MPA\nmay represent an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for subjects\ndisplaying IH.\n\nPMID: 23324505  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The slit-lamp examination showed a central corneal perforation of\n1mm in diameter, with no associated infection or inflammatory process. The\npatient had no history of trauma. It was decided to apply a patch of Tachosil(\xc2\xae) \nat the site of corneal perforation. After 36 hours of occlusion, a layer of\nfibrin covered the perforation, closing the defect. Successful healing of the\ncorneal perforation was observed in the follow-up, with no recurrences of the\nprocess.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tachosil(\xc2\xae) is collagen sponge with human fibrin and human thrombin \nused in cardiological and neurosurgical surgery for haemostasis and the occlusion\nof vessels and meninges.

Between 64-76% of patients who receive injections report\nsubjective pain improvement. Injections are usually well-tolerated with only\nmild, transient side effects, although a few case reports of patients with\nadverse effects do appear in the literature. Some clinicians have expressed\nconcerns about epidural injections above the C7-T1 level, and in the use of\nmethylprednisolone epidurally; as yet, neither is a consensus viewpoint.\nPURPOSE: This case report describes severe adverse effects (quadriplegia and\nrespiratory arrest) associated with an epidural injection into the C6-C7 space.\nAlthough the patient's symptoms improved somewhat with supportive care,\nquadriparesis appears irreversible. No reports of quadriparesis after cervical\nepidural injection were found in the literature, although other adverse effects\nhave been reported.\nSTUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The patient was injected by a fellowship-trained pain\nmanagement specialist in an outpatient surgicenter using C-arm fluoroscopic\nguidance. Immediately he experienced respiratory arrest with quadriplegia. He was\nintubated and transferred to the hospital, then transferred again to Christiana\nHealth Care Services.\nMETHODS: The patient was hospitalized, treated with steroid protocol within 8\nhours, and followed clinically for 6 months.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging within 6 hours of the injury and 6 months\nlater showed no significant findings aside from lordosis (40 degrees angle) of\nthe cervical spine at the C6-C7 level.\nCONCLUSION: Although evidence is not conclusive, this patient may have suffered a\nvascular event from a cervical epidural injection.\n\nPMID: 16153586  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A\n49-year-old premenopausal woman with a left breast tumor was admitted to our\nhospital for acute weakness of the lower limbs and dysuria. She could neither\nstand nor walk. The tumor in the left breast was 5.0 cm in diameter with skin\nulcer, and it was diagnosed as breast cancer. Magnetic resonance (MR) image\nshowed multiple vertebral and spinal metastases from breast cancer. Chemotherapy,\nconsisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) was\ninitiated. Her symptoms dramatically changed for the better. She became able to\nwalk and urinate. We performed palliative mastectomy after 3 cycles of CAF\ntherapy. Histopathological findings of breast tumor showed scirrhous carcinoma.\nAlthough the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of primary tumor was\nnegative, chemo-endocrine therapy, consisting of medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(MPA) and doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) was given as daily therapy, and vertebral and\nspinal lesions were reduced. Her condition has remained stable for 4 years. For\npatients with metastatic breast cancer, complete remission is uncommon, and\ndisease stabilization is a reasonable goal of successful therapy. In this\nrespect, therapy with CAF, followed by MPA and 5'-DFUR, was successful in the\npatient.\n\nPMID: 15628761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The serum concentration of phenytoin was well \ncontrolled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later,\ncombination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100\nmg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further\nmetastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with\nthe antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to\nfourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but\ntoxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin\nconcentration after its withdrawal.\nDISCUSSION: A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin\nmetabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The\ninteraction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it\nis reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure\nof rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the\nlikeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of\nclinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum\nphenytoin concentration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentrations when phenytoin is given in combination with fluorouracil\nderivatives, including 5'-DFUR.\n\nPMID: 11978162  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Results are conflicting as to whether there is a link between \nthe two. We describe three patients who experienced cerebral embolism during HRT.\nA 73-year-old woman had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 6 years prior to the\npresent admission. She then took HRT oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate\nfor about 6 years. The HRT had been prescribed by a gynaecologist for\namelioration of postmenopausal symptoms. Six years after beginning HRT, she\nexperienced sudden onset left hemiparesis due to cerebral embolism. Two other\npatients had been taking HRT for breast cancers. One, a 47-year-old woman, had\ntaken medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than one year, for recurrence of\nbreast cancer. She had developed sudden complete left hemiparesis due to an\nembolism at the carotid bifurcation. The other patient, a 72-year-old woman who\nwas taking tamoxifen citrate for prevention of breast cancer relapse, experienced\ncerebral embolism just 2 months after beginning tamoxifen. The risk of cerebral\nembolism in those on HRT should be emphasized, along with the beneficial effects \nin terms of postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of breast cancer recurrence.\n\nPMID: 11422601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It occurs in women of childbearing age, as episodes of pain in the\ndistribution of the sciatic nerve, which present in a cyclic manner and coincide \nwith menstruation. If it is not treated, a sensomotor mononeuropathy of the\nsciatic nerve develops.\nCLINICAL CASE: The patient had complained of right-sided sciatic pain from the\nage of 36 years. Over the years a motor deficit had slowly and progressively\nappeared causing foot drop. The painful crises were related to her menstrual\nperiods. At the age of 44 years a pyramidal muscle syndrome was diagnosed and\ntreated surgically. This was followed by increase in the crises of sciatic pain. \nA year later, she started to have sciatic pain on the left side, which was\nsimilar to that of the right side. The clinical, imaging and electrophysiological\nfindings are reported. The patient improved. She is still being treated with\ndepot medroxyprogesterone and her pain has disappeared.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cyclical sciatica due to endometriosis is little known and may lead \nto permanent disability. Computerized axial tomography of the pelvis using\ncontrast material is very useful for diagnosis. The use of depot\nmedroxyprogesterone seems to be a satisfactory treatment in some patients.\n\nPMID: 10528307  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 49-year-old woman suffering from metastatic lung\ncarcinoma from breast carcinoma was administered MPA 1200 mg/day for about four\nmonths. Thereafter she complained of dizziness about two weeks but the general\npractitioners could detect no abnormality on physical examinations and on brain\nCT X-ray findings. Six days later, she died suddenly at her home. Forensic\nautopsy findings revealed the marked superior sagital sinus thrombosis and the\nmalignant lymphadenomatosis caused by metastatic lung carcinoma. As the patient\nhad not disease or trauma causing dural sinus thrombosis except for the\nadministration of MPA, we concluded that superior sagital sinus thrombosis was\ndue to the medication of MPA. This case illustrates that forensic pathologist\nshould consider the major side effect of some drugs like our case.\n\nPMID: 9545761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In both dogs,\nbody sizes increased and a complete adult hair coat developed. Undesirable\nside-effects were recurrent periods of pruritic pyoderma in both dogs and cystic \nendometrial hyperplasia with mucometra in the female dog. Parallel with the\nphysical improvements, plasma insulin-like growth factor I concentrations rose\nsharply. Plasma GH concentrations tended to rise, but never exceeded the upper\nlimit of the reference range. Nevertheless, one of the dogs developed slight\nacromegalic features, possibly because mammary GH, unlike pituitary GH, is\nreleased evenly throughout the day. Even moderate increases in circulating GH\nconcentration may, therefore, give rise to overexposure. It is concluded that\nlong-term treatment with MPA can be used as an alternative for heterologous GH in\nthe treatment of congenital GH deficiency in the dog.\n\nPMID: 9532423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Contraception. 1997 Oct;56(4):241-4.\n\nThe contraceptive choice for a Wilson's disease patient with chronic liver\ndisease.\n\nHaimov-Kochman R(1), Ackerman Z, Anteby EY.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hadassah University Hospital-Mount\nScopus, Jerusalem, Israel.\n\nPreserved fertility status is frequently encountered in patients with Wilson's\ndisease, and contraceptive counseling may, therefore, be a relevant issue. Yet,\nseveral contraceptive methods can adversely influence the hepatic function, and\nthe efficacy of others may be affected by the liver disease. We describe a\npatient with Wilson's disease manifested by cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and\nbleeding esophageal varices who underwent termination of pregnancy at 9 weeks'\ngestation. Following the procedure, contraceptive advice was sought in order to\npostpone conception until portal hypertension was controlled and hepatic function\nimproved. Intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was administered and\ntolerated well by the patient. A detailed discussion of the contraceptive options\nfor patients with chronic liver disease, in general, and Wilson's disease, in\nparticular, follows the case report.\n\nPIP: Although the fertility status of women with Wilson's disease may be\npreserved, contraceptive method choice is complicated by the tendency for some\nmethods to have an adverse effect on hepatic function and, conversely, for liver \ndisease to compromise the efficacy of some contraceptives. This paper presents\nthe case of a 28-year-old woman diagnosed with Wilson's disease at 13 years of\nage. She presented to an Israeli hospital at 9 weeks' gestational age with\nbleeding esophageal varices, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. Although the\npatient had been oligomenorrheic, with menses every 2-3 months, she had\nexperienced 3 spontaneous first-trimester abortions. Due to the urgent need for a\nportal decompression shunt procedure and the risk of further bleeding, the\npatient opted to terminate the current pregnancy. To prevent conception until the\npatient's liver condition stabilized, she was injected with Depo-Provera and\npenicillamine treatment was resumed. Although IUDs and estrogen-containing oral\ncontraceptives are relatively contraindicated in women with liver dysfunction,\nspermicide and barrier contraceptives are highly recommended and\nprogesterone-only preparations can be safely prescribed.\nPMID: 9408705  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Studies of the toxicity of\nMedroxyprogesterone Acetate list the commonest adverse events at 500 mg/day as\nweight gain, water retention, increased blood pressure, tremor, moon face,\nsweating, muscle cramps, vaginal bleeding and increased appetite.\nGlucocorticoid-like effects are seen in up to 30% of patients treated for longer \nthan 6 weeks with mostly large doses of the order of 1500 mg/day but Cushing's\nsyndrome has been reported in patients taking 400 mg/day. Neither the\nglucocorticoid-like effects or Cushing's syndrome have been previously observed\nwith Megestrol Acetate. In the elderly female population receiving progestogens\nfor neoplastic disease the progestogen itself could be an appreciable cause of\nmorbidity both by causing glucocorticoid-like effects and Cushing's syndrome but \nalso by lack of awareness of the danger of sudden withdrawal of these compounds\nwhen the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is suppressed. The signs and\nsymptoms could be easily overlooked unless appropriate testing for Cushing's\nsyndrome is carried out. While the progestogen may have to be continued\nindefinitely a dose decrease may be feasible with reduction of morbidity.\n\nPMID: 8522428  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Five of the 7 patients were cases who had responded well\nto short-term ERT with 1.25 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) for 6\nweeks. The 7 patients from 56 to 77 years of age received 0.625 mg/day of CEE for\n21 days, followed by a pause of 7 days. A 28-day cycle of low-dose ERT was\nperformed repeatedly. In 4 cases, these patients received 5 mg/day of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) during the last 10-12 days of estrogen\ntreatment. Therapeutic efficacy of estrogen was evaluated by psychometric\nassessments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Hasegawa\nDementia Scale (HDS) and a behavior rating scale of the Gottfries-Br\xc3\xa5ne-Steen\ngeriatric rating scale (GBS). The MMSE and HDS evaluations were performed\nprincipally once in 2-4 weeks. In 4 out of the 7 patients, the MMSE and HDS\nscores were elevated above the pretreatment levels during ERT. The termination of\nERT resulted in a decrease in both scores. Furthermore, the GBS scores and daily \nactivities of the same 4 patients were improved during ERT. In these 4 patients\ncognitive functions were markedly improved throughout the treatment period, while\nthe other 2 patients responded moderately well and another patient did not\nrespond at all. These observations suggest that long-term, low-dose ERT improves \ncognitive functions, dementia symptoms and daily activities in women with mild to\nmoderate DAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 7606287  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Mild and diffuse\nencephalopathies were noted through EEG recordings. No definite epileptiform\nabnormalities or focal supratentorial lesions were seen and the pattern was\nconsistent with patients with post-encephalitis. Treatment of this patient\ninvolved the use of anti-androgen and antianxiety pharmacotherapy along with\ncounseling to provide basic sex education and specific education for socially\naccepted sexual behavior. Follow-up evaluation several yrs later indicated good\ntreatment results. This case illustrates potential sources of sexually deviant\nbehavior and treatment options. Promising new drug treatments are available which\nact as sexuoerotic tranquilizers as well as treatments for underlying or\nconcomitant psychiatric disorders. In this case, however, family dynamics and\npoor sex education seemed to account for most of this patient's difficulties.\nCounseling and psychoeducation proved to be quite effective in resolving\nproblematic behavior.\n\nPMID: 7964261  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The authors report two cases of STB with pulmonary involvement\noccurring in the same family, mother and daughter. Both presented with typical\ncutaneous manifestations of the disease and bilateral renal angiomyolipomas. In\nthe daughter, the early pulmonary diagnosis was made by computed tomographic\nexamination (TDM) which showed the images of the cyst very sharply, although the \npulmonary radiograph was normal. Prolonged follow up with pulmonary function\ntests is important. Lung function tests were very abnormal in the mother with a\nfrank diminution of the TLCO and hypoxia at rest. In the daughter, they revealed \nthe development of obstructive airways disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage was\ncarried out in both the mother and daughter and showed intra-alveolar haemorrhage\n(with a ground glass appearance on computed tomography in the mother). Pulmonary \nlymphangiomyomatosis (LPM) and STB with pulmonary involvement are clinical\ndisorders which are anatomically closely related. If the value of hormonal\ntreatment has been shown during the course of LMP, their efficacy in STB is\nvariable.\n\nPMID: 8235029  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Thus, a dose of 1200 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate was\nstarted. Although the histology of his prostate and bone scintigram did not\nchange, the patient no longer felt lumbago from about 2 weeks after the start of \nthis treatment.

The\npatient had been treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for 8 months. The\nincrease in FRC was obtained by applying a constant negative extrathoracic\npressure (NEP) with a poncho-type respirator. With pulmonary inflation, there was\na dramatic decrease in the apnea index and the percent apnea time, and an\nimprovement in sleep architecture. At all sleep stages, the desaturation duration\nwas shorter with NEP. The exact mechanisms by which pulmonary expansion improved \nsleep apnea in this patient remain unclear; lung volume dependence of upper\nairway patency and the improvements in apnea-induced desaturation may be\ncontributing factors. Our observation illustrates that lung volumes may be an\nimportant factor in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea, especially in\nthe apnea onset and in the apneic-induced desaturation.\n\nPMID: 2974620  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Weight, pulmonary function, arterial blood gases, minute\nventilation to carbon dioxide production ratio (VE/VCO2), and the ventilatory\nresponse to exercise (delta VE/delta VCO2) were normal. Episodes of obstructive\napnea (4 per hour during non-REM (NREM) and 10 per hour during REM) and oxygen\ndesaturation (9 per hour during NREM and 11 per hour during REM) were common\nduring sleep. Oxygen saturation ranged between 72 and 99% and 70 and 97% during\nNREM and REM sleep, respectively. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy for 4\nwk caused a reduction in awake PaCO2 (38 to 33 mm Hg), and an increase in VE/VCO2\n(17%), mouth occlusion pressure (50%), and AVE/VCO2 (23%). During sleep, apneas\nwere completely eliminated and only one episode of oxygen desaturation occurred. \nL-thyroxine therapy for 2 months after a placebo period caused an awake isocapnic\nhyperpnea with no change in PaCO2 and VE/VCO2 despite a 23% increase in VE. Mouth\nocclusion pressure increased 37% but delta VE/delta VCO2 was unchanged.\nObstructive apnea and oxygen desaturation during sleep were completely eliminated\nwith L-thyroxine. The patient noted completed relief of symptoms with both MPA\nand L-thyroxine. We concluded that the sleep apnea syndrome was the presenting\nmanifestation of hypothyroidism in this patient and was solely responsible for\nhis symptoms and disability.\n\nPMID: 6792957  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This work\npresents an evaluation of the usefulness of ultrasound examination of the pelvis \nin females with aberrant sexual development. Girls with these problems often need\nmultiple pelvic examinations to monitor their uterine response to hormone\ntherapy. Thirty-two patients with a variety of abnormalities including Mullerian \nagenesis and hypothalamic hypogonadism as well as patients with abnormal\nkaryotype commonly associated with gonadal dysgenesis and male\npseudohermaphrodism were studied. Repeat ultrasound scans were performed to\nquantitate uterine response to therapy. Ovarian visualization was usually\npossible, even in prepuberal girls. Following some patients at risk for gonadal\ntumors may be possible using repeat ultrasound examinations. The cooperation of\nthe patients as well as of their families was gratifying, and the girls appeared \nto be more relaxed during ultrasound examination than during a pelvic\nexamination.\n\nPMID: 6277836  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient, a\n40-year old Chinese woman had smoked 30 cigarettes daily for many years. She\nreceived injections of 150 mg Depo-Provera in April and July 1979. 2 days after\nthe 2nd injection she was admitted to the hospital for vomiting and vertigo of 2 \ndays duration. Clinical examination showed a 12th nerve palsy with the tongue\ndeviated to the right but no other neurological abnormalities. She was treated\nsymptomatically with intravenous fluids and stemetil and improved. On the 5th day\nher vertigo and vomiting progressed and she developed more lower brain stem\nsigns. The same day she had a grand mal fit and went into a coma. She died on the\n7th hospital day. A partial autopsy limited to the skull revealed minimal\natherosclerosis of the vertebral artery but no thrombosis or occlusion. Cut\nsections after perfusion revealed an area of softening associated with some\nhemorrhage involving the whole length of the right half of the medulla oblongata \ndorsal to the olivary nucleus. Histological examination revealed an infarct\nundergoing liquefaction necrosis. The possibility of a causative relationship is \nsuggested by the development of tinnitis about 12 hours after injection of\nDepo-Provera.\nPMID: 6452693  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thus, a dose of 1200 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate was\nstarted. Although the histology of his prostate and bone scintigram did not\nchange, the patient no longer felt lumbago from about 2 weeks after the start of \nthis treatment. Six months later, he remains free of lumbago.

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin. Recurrent AEH had undergone malignant transformation,\nresulting in the development of well- and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma\nand tumor exhibiting germ-cell-like differentiation. The patient died of a\nmassive tumor extension 7 months after surgery. The AEH before MPA therapy and\nthe recurrent tumors had genetically different characteristics based on evidence \nof a loss of heterozygosity, detected at D8S1132 (chromosomal locus, 8q22.1) in\nthe latter but not in the former, by analysis of genetic alterations using\nmicrosatellite markers.\n\nPMID: 15144406  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Blasts disappeared from\nthe peripheral blood but persisted at a level of 60% in the bone marrow. After 5 \nweeks of continuous therapy, the patient became thrombopenic, and 2 weeks later\nblasts rose to 31%. After 7 weeks, 1 g MPA was given daily p.o. and weekly\nvincristine treatment was resumed. Blasts disappeared again from the peripheral\nblood, thrombocytes rose to a maximum of 274 g/l, and a remission with less than \n5% blasts was demonstrated in the bone marrow. In another relapse after\nwithdrawal of MPA, estrogen and progesterone receptors (PR) were found in the\nleukemic cells. Thus, a remission was seen during treatment with vincristine,\nprednisone, and MPA after a deterioration with vincristine and prednisone alone\nin a PR-positive leukemia, and an effect of MPA in this lymphoid blast crisis of \na CML has to be discussed.\n\nPMID: 8148420  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nfirst patient with stage IVb moderately-differentiated endometrioid\nadenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus underwent initial operation and\npostoperative chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy. Four months\nlater, lung metastases were found. Since the hormone receptor status was\npositive, the patient was treated with MPA, and CR was achieved. The second\npatient with stage IIIc poorly-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the \nuterine corpus developed lung metastases 14 months after the initial operation\nand postoperative chemotherapy. Subsequent chemotherapy yielded a complete\nresponse(CR). Two months later, however, a small intestinal metastasis was\nobserved, which was treated by surgical excision and chemotherapy. The patient\nagain remained disease-free for four months until lung metastases were observed. \nSince the hormone receptor status was positive, the patient was treated with MPA,\nand CR was achieved. No serious adverse events were observed in either patient.\n\nPMID: 20414038  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Objective responses\nby hormonal treatment with progestin or aromatase inhibitor have been reported,\nhowever, long-term management of this disease could be difficult if it becomes\nrefractory to one of these hormonal therapies. A 34-year-old woman was diagnosed \nwith stage I low-grade ESS at the time of hysterectomy for presumed uterine\nfibroma. Five years later, she recurred with multiple tumors in the lower\nabdomen. After an optimal surgery, she was free from progression for 6\xc2\xa0years with\nprogestin treatment (medroxyprogesterone acetate: MPA, 200-600\xc2\xa0mg daily).\nThereafter, she recurred twice during the MPA treatment and received debulking\nsurgery each time. MPA was discontinued at age of 53, because another recurrent\ntumor grew up to 13\xc2\xa0cm in diameter. Aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was then\ngiven at a daily dose of 1\xc2\xa0mg with partial response (the tumor size decreased to \n7\xc2\xa0cm in diameter) for a duration of 9\xc2\xa0months. After complete resection of the\nrecurrent tumor, she remains progression-free for 16\xc2\xa0months. Anastrozole was\neffective to recurrent low-grade ESS even after being refractory to progestin\ntherapy. Aromatase inhibitor treatment may be a useful option as a second-line\nhormonal treatment to low-grade ESS.\n\nPMID: 20354812  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It accounts for 0.5% of all\nuterine corpus malignant tumors and 10% of all malignant non-epithelial tumors.\nMPA is one effective hormonal treatment for ESS. We describe two cases in which\npatients with metastatic low-grade ESS lesions had prolonged survival with MPA\ntherapy. Case 1 was a 50-year-old woman with a low-grade uterine endometrial\nstromal tumor who had been operated on at another hospital. She had been followed\nfor three years. She had pelvis metastases with infiltration into the bladder,\nand pulmonary metastases. She had an incomplete response to chemotherapy. We\ninitiated MPA therapy, which resulted in significant improvement in her\nmetastatic lesions. Case 2 was a 58-year-old woman with stage Ic low-grade ESS\nwho presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. Following surgery (TAH+BSO), MPA\ntherapy was initiated and she had no recurrence. After 1 year and 7 months, she\ndiscontinued the MPA because it worsened her articular rheumatism. Her cancer\nrecurred with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis. She was treated with\nchemotherapy, MPA and radiotherapy. Her metastases improved, and the patient has \ncontinued to survive on MPA therapy alone. These cases suggest that MPA might be \nan effective hormonal therapy for patients with low-grade ESS.\n\nPMID: 18487930  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype. Minor AEH was present in the exophytic area, in which some glands were\ncystically dilated. Part of the AEH had transformed into other histologic\nfeatures with germ-cell-like differentiation, demonstrated by immunohistochemical\npositive reaction of placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and human\nchorionic gonadotrophin. Recurrent AEH had undergone malignant transformation,\nresulting in the development of well- and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma\nand tumor exhibiting germ-cell-like differentiation. The patient died of a\nmassive tumor extension 7 months after surgery. The AEH before MPA therapy and\nthe recurrent tumors had genetically different characteristics based on evidence \nof a loss of heterozygosity, detected at D8S1132 (chromosomal locus, 8q22.1) in\nthe latter but not in the former, by analysis of genetic alterations using\nmicrosatellite markers.\n\nPMID: 15144406  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

But in poor cases, like renal failure and such, it is\ndifficult to perform the therapy. Two cases of recurrent uterine endometrial\ncancer treated earlier with MPA were presently treated with an addition of\netoposide. The first case was given etoposide (50 mg/m2/day 4 times for 21 days\nby oral administration). The target tumor mass was reduced in size, occult blood \nvanished, and the tumor marker was reduced. The other case was treated with\netoposide, 50 mg/body/day for 21 days by oral administration, but because of\ndiarrhea, the dose had to be decreased to 25 mg/body/day every day. The tumor\nmarker was reduced and genital bleeding vanished. These cases suggested that\netoposide-MPA combined therapy might be effective for recurrent uterine\nendometrial cancer of well-differentiated type.\n\nPMID: 7826070  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient had a medical history\nincluding chronic stable hepatitis C infection. At diagnosis there was a severe\nanemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, IgG paraproteinemia, peripheral blood\nmyeloma cells, and a marrow plasmacytosis with lytic bony lesion. The disease was\nrefractory to standard chemotherapy, and she was treated with oral thalidomide.\nWithin 1 week she became jaundiced and developed a marked transaminitis. This\npromptly resolved upon cessation of thalidomide alone. Thalidomide has recently\nenjoyed renewed interest as a treatment in many disorders, including plasma cell \nleukemia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of\nthalidomide-associated hepatotoxicity. Although the mechanism of its actions on\nthe liver are uncertain, it is possible that thalidomide acts as a direct\nhepatotoxin or as an immuno-modulator, altering the activity of chronic viral\nhepatitis. We present this case to increase awareness of a new potential side\neffect of thalidomide as its clinical indications expand.\n\nCopyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nPMID: 11279644  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Blasts disappeared from\nthe peripheral blood but persisted at a level of 60% in the bone marrow. After 5 \nweeks of continuous therapy, the patient became thrombopenic, and 2 weeks later\nblasts rose to 31%. After 7 weeks, 1 g MPA was given daily p.o. and weekly\nvincristine treatment was resumed. Blasts disappeared again from the peripheral\nblood, thrombocytes rose to a maximum of 274 g/l, and a remission with less than \n5% blasts was demonstrated in the bone marrow. In another relapse after\nwithdrawal of MPA, estrogen and progesterone receptors (PR) were found in the\nleukemic cells. Thus, a remission was seen during treatment with vincristine,\nprednisone, and MPA after a deterioration with vincristine and prednisone alone\nin a PR-positive leukemia, and an effect of MPA in this lymphoid blast crisis of \na CML has to be discussed.\n\nPMID: 8148420  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A\n61-year-old woman visited our hospital due to an abnormal chest shadow. Computed \ntomograhy showed a mass that was composed of a cystic and solid lesion, in the\nright lower lobe. She had undergone a combination of a hysterectomy and\nadnexectomy for a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma 57 months previously, and\nundergone adjuvant radiation therapy at the local site. To obtain a definitive\ndiagnosis of the lung tumor, we performed lobectomy of the right lower lobe and\nlymph node dissection. To avoid possible dissemination, the tumor was resected\nnot using video-assisted thoracic surgery but using thoracotomy.

Case 1 was a 61-year-old postmenopausal\nfemale. At 32 postoperative months, multiple metastases of lung and bone were\nfound. Following unsuccessful treatment with anthracyclin and an antiestrogenic\nagent, we used MVP modified therapy (mitoxantrone (MIT) 16 mg and vincristine\n(VCR) 1.6 mg once per 4 weeks and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1,200 mg/day)\nand 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/daily. After 12 cycles were\nperformed, the patient showed a partial response (PR) (nearly complete response\n(CR)) on a chest X-ray and bone scintigram. Case 2 was a 49-year-old\npremenopausal female. At 42 postoperative months, a local recurrence was found\nand resection was performed. However, after endocrine therapy with goserelin\nacetate (ZOL) and chemotherapy with CAF (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and 5-FU)\nand UFT, local recurrence and pleural effusion were found 6 months after surgical\noperation.

However, breast \ncancer frequently metastasizes to the sternum as solitary metastasis. Resection\nof the sternum was reported to be an effective surgical technique for sternum\nmetastasis which could not be remarkably improved by chemo-endocrine therapy and \nlocoregional recurrent breast cancer invading the skin. A first patient was\ndiagnosed with sternum metastasis invading the skin 44 months after radical\nmastectomy for breast cancer of stage II. A second patient had breast cancer of\nstage IV simultaneously with metastases to the sternum and the lung. Only the\nlung metastasis was successfully controlled by chemo-endocrine therapy, but the\nsternum metastasis was progressive, following radical mastectomy. Both patients\nmanifested solitary bone metastases and underwent full-thickness chest wall\nresection. The defect of the chest wall was reconstructed with the mucocutaneous \nflap using the dorsal latissimus muscle in case 1 and with the abdominal rectus\nmuscle in case 2. Twenty months after the resection of the sternum, the first\npatient suffered from supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, and the\nmultidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy was indicated. This\ntherapeutic procedure was effective, and the patient survived for 63 months after\nresection of the sternum. The second patient has made good progress for six\nmonths in maintaining complete remission with chemo-endocrine therapy. These\nfindings suggested that surgical resection was a useful local treatment for\nsolitary sternum metastasis.\n\nPMID: 9703824  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thereafter she complained of dizziness about two weeks but the general\npractitioners could detect no abnormality on physical examinations and on brain\nCT X-ray findings. Six days later, she died suddenly at her home. Forensic\nautopsy findings revealed the marked superior sagital sinus thrombosis and the\nmalignant lymphadenomatosis caused by metastatic lung carcinoma. As the patient\nhad not disease or trauma causing dural sinus thrombosis except for the\nadministration of MPA, we concluded that superior sagital sinus thrombosis was\ndue to the medication of MPA.

Her only symptom was hemosputa. The lesions were suspected of being\nmetastasizing leiomyoma due to her past history of uterine leiomyoma. Just 1 week\nbefore undergoing scheduled open lung biopsy, the lung lesions increased\nremarkably in size and number. A thoracotomy was performed and six of the\nnumerous nodules were removed. The resected specimens were pathologically\ndiagnosed as metastasizing leimyosarcoma which was positive for the progesterone \nand estrogen receptors. Thus, 1 month postoperatively, a course of\nmedroxyprogesterone (MPA), 600 mg daily, was commenced. The residual lesions in\nher chest started to diminish, shortly afterward. She has remained well on this\nMPA regimen for 45 months. The prognosis of patients with metastasizing\nleiomyosarcoma is poor because of its low sensitivity to chemotherapy; however,\nsome types of leiomyosarcoma are hormone-sensitive. It is therefore important to \nexamine the hormone receptors of excised tumors from patients suspected of having\nmetastasizing leiomyoma or leimyosarcoma.\n\nPMID: 8919287  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

LAM is a hormone dependent disease,\nbut our knowledge is still incomplete. Hormonal manipulation should be tried in\nreceptor positive as well as negative patients. Tamoxifen seems to have\ndeleterious effects on the course of disease.\n\nPMID: 8346582  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

On admission, \na left inguinal tumor was found and histologically it consisted of smooth muscle \ncells with nuclear atypia arranged in interlacing fascicles. An open-lung biopsy \nwas performed. Pulmonary tumors revealed similar histology to the inguinal tumor.\nThey were diagnosed as metastatic low-grade leiomyosarcoma, so-called benign\nmetastasizing leiomyoma (BML), on the basis of location and history, reinforced\nby mild histologic atypia. The tumor contained a high progesterone receptor level\n(400 fmol/mg). Therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate, 600 mg daily, was\nadministered orally. At two years the pulmonary lesions had regressed. BML is a\nrare condition, considered to be pulmonary metastasis from low-grade\nleiomyosarcoma of the uterus. Measuring estrogen and progesterone receptors in\nlung biopy material may help determine the most appropriate therapy.\n\nPMID: 8366630  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Eighty patients of\nrenal cell carcinoma were treated during the period. Of those patients 13 (10\nmales and 3 females) had pulmonary metastasis and their ages were between 52 and \n74 (average 61.6). The therapies we performed were surgical resection, cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, BRM (biological response modifier) therapy, hormone therapy and\nirradiation therapy. Four patients became tumor free by administration of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate, interferon-alpha, UFT (a compound combining tegafur \nand uracil) and surgical resection respectively. In 1 patient, administration of \nUFT resulted in partial remission. Cytotoxic chemotherapy using cisplatin,\nvinblastine and doxorubicin, and irradiation therapy were not effective. These\nfindings suggest that BRM therapy, UFT therapy and hormone therapy are effective \nin eliminating pulmonary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma, particularly in the \npatients with excellent performance status whose original lesions had been\nresected.\n\nPMID: 2148250  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It results from a tumorlike\nproliferation of smooth muscle in the thoracic and retroperitoneal lymphatics.\nProminent clinical findings are dyspnea, spontaneous pneumothorax, chylous\npleural effusions and chylous ascites. The diagnosis results from typical chest\nX-rays and is established by open lung biopsy. Treatment should primarily start\nwith medroxyprogesteronacetat (respectively tamoxifen), if necessary with\nconsideration of the hormonal receptors. In an early stage the oophorectomy can\nbe helpful. Surgical intervention is necessary in complications (thoracic\ndrainage, pleurectomy for recurrent pneumothorax, Le Veen-shunt for chylous\nascites). If hormonal therapy is not successful, a combined heart and lung\ntransplantation should be attempted in ultima ratio.\n\nPMID: 2140768  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It accounts for 0.5% of all\nuterine corpus malignant tumors and 10% of all malignant non-epithelial tumors.\nMPA is one effective hormonal treatment for ESS. We describe two cases in which\npatients with metastatic low-grade ESS lesions had prolonged survival with MPA\ntherapy. Case 1 was a 50-year-old woman with a low-grade uterine endometrial\nstromal tumor who had been operated on at another hospital. She had been followed\nfor three years. She had pelvis metastases with infiltration into the bladder,\nand pulmonary metastases. She had an incomplete response to chemotherapy. We\ninitiated MPA therapy, which resulted in significant improvement in her\nmetastatic lesions. Case 2 was a 58-year-old woman with stage Ic low-grade ESS\nwho presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. Following surgery (TAH+BSO), MPA\ntherapy was initiated and she had no recurrence. After 1 year and 7 months, she\ndiscontinued the MPA because it worsened her articular rheumatism. Her cancer\nrecurred with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis. She was treated with\nchemotherapy, MPA and radiotherapy. Her metastases improved, and the patient has \ncontinued to survive on MPA therapy alone. These cases suggest that MPA might be \nan effective hormonal therapy for patients with low-grade ESS.\n\nPMID: 18487930  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, breast \ncancer frequently metastasizes to the sternum as solitary metastasis. Resection\nof the sternum was reported to be an effective surgical technique for sternum\nmetastasis which could not be remarkably improved by chemo-endocrine therapy and \nlocoregional recurrent breast cancer invading the skin. A first patient was\ndiagnosed with sternum metastasis invading the skin 44 months after radical\nmastectomy for breast cancer of stage II. A second patient had breast cancer of\nstage IV simultaneously with metastases to the sternum and the lung. Only the\nlung metastasis was successfully controlled by chemo-endocrine therapy, but the\nsternum metastasis was progressive, following radical mastectomy. Both patients\nmanifested solitary bone metastases and underwent full-thickness chest wall\nresection. The defect of the chest wall was reconstructed with the mucocutaneous \nflap using the dorsal latissimus muscle in case 1 and with the abdominal rectus\nmuscle in case 2. Twenty months after the resection of the sternum, the first\npatient suffered from supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, and the\nmultidisciplinary treatment including radiation therapy was indicated. This\ntherapeutic procedure was effective, and the patient survived for 63 months after\nresection of the sternum. The second patient has made good progress for six\nmonths in maintaining complete remission with chemo-endocrine therapy. These\nfindings suggested that surgical resection was a useful local treatment for\nsolitary sternum metastasis.\n\nPMID: 9703824  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

About 2 years later, CT showed 2.7 cm mass in the left lung. Left upper\nlobectomy was performed in August 2000, and it was a metastasis of RCC, G2.\nIFN-alpha and IFN-gamma were administered. Nine months later, in June 2001, the\nrecurrence of the left kidney and the left adrenal gland was found and partial\nnephrectomy and adrenalectomy was performed. Pathological finding was RCC, G3.\nIFN-alpha and tegafur-uracil (UFT) were administered. Only 3 months later,\nrecurrence of the left kidney and the left adrenal gland and the lymph node of\nrenal hilus was found. We gave up for surgical resection and chemotherapy of MVP \n(Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Pepleomycin) was performed. Despite the therapy,\ndisease progressed. 10 months after the last recurrence, in July 2002, patient\nbecame disoriented and hypercalcemia and the MVP therapy was stopped. After that,\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and UFT were administered; the patient lived 20\nmonths with relatively good performance status and died in February 2004. MPA\nmight be considered as a drug for advanced renal cell carcinoma.\n\nPMID: 17933137  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

As a primary treatment, 12 \ncases chose hormonal treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 600 mg/day)\ndue to no findings of myometrial invasion and diagnosis of a grade 1,\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In remaining 19 cases, surgery was performed.\nAll the 19 patients who received surgery as a primary treatment are alive, with\nno evidence of a recurrence of the disease. In the 12 patients who received\nhormonal treatment, 8 patients eventually received a hysterectomy because of\nrecurrence or no response to MPA. Of these eight patients, myometrial invasion\nwas recognized in three patients. One of the eight patients died of the\nmetastasized disease to the liver and brain after hysterectomy. After hormonal\ntreatment, 4 of the 12 patients were exempted from surgery and showed no evidence\nof recurrence. Two patients had viable children. Progesterone receptor was\nnegative in one case that died. Careful consideration should be given to hormonal\ntreatment with MPA for the conservative management of endometrial carcinoma in\nyoung women. Moreover, MPA is not always a consistent management for every\npatient.\n\nPMID: 16014120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nAEH was found by repeated cytologic and histologic examinations to have\ncompletely disappeared with the therapy, but 3 years after her last follow up she\nrequired emergency surgery to treat severe genital bleeding. The hysterectomied\nuterus consisted mostly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, G3 endometrioid \ntype.

Endometrial curettage was performed and the absence of\nendometrial carcinoma was confirmed. A single pregnancy was achieved with in\nvitro fertilization and embryo transfer. A healthy female infant was born via\ncesarean section at 42 weeks' gestation. The carcinoma has not recurred, and the \npatient now desires a second child. We conclude that ART combined with\nprogesterone treatment might be a powerful option for the treatment of infertile \npatients with early stage, well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma.\n\nCopyright 2001 S.

However, it\nis not known for certain whether the lesion is completely eradicated in such\npatients. We present a case of residual endometrial carcinoma after term\npregnancy which had been treated conservatively before the pregnancy began.\nCASE: A 28-year-old woman with endometrial carcinoma received conservative\ntreatment with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and then conceived.\nAfter delivery at term, atypical cells were found in the endometrial curettage\nspecimen. A hysterectomy was performed 6 months after delivery and revealed the\npresence of a small focus of intramucosal, grade 1, endometrioid-type\nadenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for estrogen\nand progesterone receptors.\nCONCLUSION: We concluded that while MPA treatment had been effective, it had not \ncompletely eradicated the carcinomatous lesion, which remained during and after\nthe term pregnancy.\n\nCopyright 2000 Academic Press.\n\nPMID: 11006045  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 43-year-old Japanese woman\ndeveloped bone metastases 3 years after surgery. Subsequent radiotherapy and\nchemoendocrine therapy with CAF (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil)\nand tamoxifen all failed, and she could not sit up because of bone metastases.\nThe performance status (PS) on admission was grade 4. After admission, delirium\naccompanied with sensory and visual hallucination caused by intense anxiety\noccurred, and a continuous consultation by psychiatrists was necessary. MPA\ntreatment at the dose of 1200 mg/day alleviated the bone pain, thus improving her\nPS to grade 1. Her appetite also improved, while her mental state stabilized. A\nbone scintigram revealed an improvement of bone metastases, and the tumor markers\nalso returned to normal values. The patient thus showed a pronounced improvement \nin her QOL due to both MPA treatment and team medical care. The role of the\nmedical staff as well as the importance of their cooperation in achieving an\nimprovement in the QOL of cancer patients is also discussed.\n\nPMID: 9744415  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

But in poor cases, like renal failure and such, it is\ndifficult to perform the therapy. Two cases of recurrent uterine endometrial\ncancer treated earlier with MPA were presently treated with an addition of\netoposide. The first case was given etoposide (50 mg/m2/day 4 times for 21 days\nby oral administration). The target tumor mass was reduced in size, occult blood \nvanished, and the tumor marker was reduced. The other case was treated with\netoposide, 50 mg/body/day for 21 days by oral administration, but because of\ndiarrhea, the dose had to be decreased to 25 mg/body/day every day. The tumor\nmarker was reduced and genital bleeding vanished.

Eighty patients of\nrenal cell carcinoma were treated during the period. Of those patients 13 (10\nmales and 3 females) had pulmonary metastasis and their ages were between 52 and \n74 (average 61.6). The therapies we performed were surgical resection, cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, BRM (biological response modifier) therapy, hormone therapy and\nirradiation therapy. Four patients became tumor free by administration of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate, interferon-alpha, UFT (a compound combining tegafur \nand uracil) and surgical resection respectively. In 1 patient, administration of \nUFT resulted in partial remission. Cytotoxic chemotherapy using cisplatin,\nvinblastine and doxorubicin, and irradiation therapy were not effective. These\nfindings suggest that BRM therapy, UFT therapy and hormone therapy are effective \nin eliminating pulmonary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma, particularly in the \npatients with excellent performance status whose original lesions had been\nresected.\n\nPMID: 2148250  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and\ntreated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the\nX-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment\nwas similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy \nwas done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given\nwithout side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic\nX-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search \nfor a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total\nhistologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for\nradiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 \nmg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue\nsensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if\naccompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of\nthe endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of\nestrogens.\nPMID: 980740  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

An immune-mediated disorder, \nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, was diagnosed when she was 15 years\nold. Clinical examination and laboratory findings revealed a PGA syndrome due to \nthe presence of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, insufficient growth hormone\nresponse and thyroid autoimmunity. The patient had neither adrenal disease nor\nhypoparathyroidism. Therefore we concluded that this patient has PGA syndrome\ntype III. This is an interesting case, because we could not find any previous\nreport of such coexistence between PGA type III and CVID in a Medline search.\nCoexistence of these two entities may be a result of autoimmunity and the\nassociation of both conditions with human leukocyte antigen.\n\nPMID: 15625773  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Califano, Italy.\n\nThe coexistence of autoimmune endocrine diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid\ndisease and celiac disease (CD), has recently been reported. We here present a\n23-year-old woman with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's\nthyroiditis, autoimmune Addison's disease, and kariotypically normal spontaneous \npremature ovarian failure. Considering the close association between autoimmune\ndiseases and CD, we decided to search for IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) in\nthe serum. The positivity of EmA and the presence of total villous atrophy at\njejunal biopsy allowed the diagnosis of CD. On a gluten-free diet the patient\nshowed a marked clinical improvement accompanied, over a 3-month period, by a\nprogressive decrease in the need for thyroid and adrenal replacement therapies.\nAfter 6 months, serum EmA became negative and after 12 months a new jejunal\nbiopsy showed complete mucosal recovery. After 18 months on gluten-free diet, the\nanti-thyroid antibodies titre decreased significantly, and we could discontinue\nthyroid substitutive therapy. This case emphasizes the association between\nautoimmune polyglandular disease and CD; the precocious identification of these\ncases is clinically relevant not only for the high risk of complications (e.g.\nlymphoma) inherent to untreated CD, but also because CD is one of the causes for \nthe failure of substitute hormonal therapy in patients with autoimmune thyroid\ndisease.\n\nPMID: 10401714  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The serum concentration of phenytoin was well \ncontrolled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later,\ncombination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100\nmg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further\nmetastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with\nthe antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to\nfourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but\ntoxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin\nconcentration after its withdrawal.\nDISCUSSION: A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin\nmetabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The\ninteraction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it\nis reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure\nof rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the\nlikeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of\nclinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum\nphenytoin concentration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the elevation of serum phenytoin\nconcentrations when phenytoin is given in combination with fluorouracil\nderivatives, including 5'-DFUR.\n\nPMID: 11978162  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

All published cases of PRCA induced by pregnancy\nwere reviewed. Additionally, we reported a patient who developed PRCA on three\noccasions; two were triggered by pregnancy and one after medroxyprogesterone\nadministration. Ten patients with 13 pregnancy-induced PRCA episodes were\nreported. The PRCA occurred at any gestational age. All patients received blood\ntransfusions, and six of them were treated corticosteroids. The PRCA resolved in \nall subjects postpartum. Five women had subsequent pregnancies; three were\ncomplicated by PRCA, one was normal, and one had spontaneous abortion without\nPRCA. One subject developed a PRCA after long-term exposure to\nmedroxyprogesterone. Infant blood values were normal in the nine reported cases. \nPregnancy-induced PRCA is a self-limited syndrome with a high risk for relapse\nduring subsequent pregnancies. It can be managed by blood transfusions.\nProgestins might cause PRCA in these women.\n\nPMID: 17262194  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Since menarche, she had suffered from severe\nmenorrhagia, but she had assumed that this was unrelated to her mother's history \nof repeated life-threatening bleeding. Her menorraghia was evident by using\ngreater than 100 pads per period, bleeding as long as 4 continuous months, and\neven bleeding through her clothes despite using both tampons and pads. Evaluation\nwith pelvic examination, endometrial biopsy, and pelvic ultrasound was\nunremarkable. Medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment for her dysfunctional uterine\nbleeding was unsuccessful. Laboratory evaluation revealed iron deficiency anemia \nbut otherwise normal platelets, bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated\npartial thromboplastin time, and vonWillebrand's studies. Despite any\npreconceptions, examination for a fibrinolytic defect ultimately demonstrated a\nPAI-1 antigen level of 11.4 ng/mL (4.0-43 ng/mL) and PAI-1 activity less than 5\nAU/mL (5-37 AU/mL) and clinically supported a diagnosis of a hereditary,\nqualitative PAI-1 defect. She was treated with aminocaproic acid with return to\nrelatively normal menses. Future treatment should also prevent excessive bleeding\nduring trauma, surgery, or childbirth. Further evaluation of this patient and her\nfamily is planned and may help elucidate the important role of PAI-1 in the\ncomplicated balance between hemostasis and hemorrhage.\n\nPMID: 15247991  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Given\nher history, due to the fear of a malignant process arising from a potential\ngonadal remnant, she underwent a laparoscopy and was found to have a 5 cm serosal\nendometrioma arising on a stalk from the uterine fundal surface as well as pelvic\nendometriosis. De-novo endometrioma and endometriosis occurred in a mosaic\nTurner's patient after gonadectomy on cyclic HRT. The presentation was also\nunusual with a pedunculated endometrioma arising from the uterine serosa. Due to \nthe fact that the patient did have cyclic menstrual flow, her endometriosis may\nhave arisen from retrograde menstruation or coelomic metaplasia induced by\nexogenous hormones.\n\nPMID: 12407060  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

All three patients had normal \nblood leukocyte and ovarian tissue karyotypes. The importance of performing a\ndiagnostic laparoscopy with ovarian biopsy in the setting of chromosome competent\novarian failure (CCOF) is emphasized.\n\nPIP: The cases are described of 3 female adolescents evaluated at the Cincinnati \nAdolescent Clinic for delayed or incomplete secondary sexual development due to\nprimary ovarian failure. All 3 patients had normal blood leukocyte and ovarian\ntissue karyotypes. The clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings are\ndiscussed with emphasis on distinguishing chromosome incompetent ovarian failure \n(CIOF-Turner's syndrome) from chromosome competent ovarian failure (CCOF). The\npatients included a 15 1/2 year old black female who sought evaluation of obesity\nand lethargy, a 17 1/2 year old white female with secondary amenorrhea in whom\noral provera failed to induce menstrual flow, and a 17 1/2 year old black female \nwith scanty, infrequent menses who achieved a normal amount and duration of\nmenstrual flow with Norinyl 1 + 80. Hypoestrogenization should be suspected in\ncases of incomplete breast development for age, thin vaginal mucosa with a\nprepubertal pattern of the vaginal cytology, scant cervical mucus without\nferning, and lack of withdrawal bleeding after progesterone administration. If\nany decrease in ovarian steroid production is clinically suspected in an\nadolescent with primary or secondary amenorrhea associated with delayed or\nincomplete puberty, serum gonadotropin levels should be measured. A single\nelevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the menopausal range is\ndiagnostic of primary ovarian failure in an adolescent. If the FSH is low or\nnormal, hypothalamic or pituitary disease would be suspected. A blood leukocyte\nkaryotype is the next diagnostic procedure for patients with primary ovarian\nfailure to distinguish between CCOF and CIOF. If the blood karyotype is XO or a\nvariant without a Y cell line, no further cytogenic workup or visualization of\nthe gonads is needed, but girls with blood karyotype of XX or a mosaic pattern\nwith 1 cell line with a Y chromosome should undergo laparoscopy and gonadal\nbiopsy. A unilateral testis should be removed to avoid malignant changes in later\nyears. Patients with CCOF may have other endocrine dysfunction, particularly\nautoimmune disease. Other possible diagnoses include resistant ovary syndrome,\npure gonadal dysgenesis, premature menopause, or infectious, chemical, or other\ncauses of ovarian failure. The incidence of CIOF is greater than that of CCOF\namong patients with primary ovarian failure. Optimal treatment requires medical\nand psychosocial intervention.\nPMID: 6315654  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Gynecologists are often\nconsulted before transplant for management of abnormal uterine bleeding, which\nmay be particularly challenging in this context.\nCASE: A premenopausal woman with MonoMAC (a rare adult-onset immunodeficiency\nsyndrome characterized by monocytopenia and Mycobacterium avium complex\ninfections resulting from mutations in GATA2, a crucial gene in early\nhematopoiesis) presented with pancytopenia, evolving leukemia, and recent\nstrokes, necessitating anticoagulation. During preparation for hematopoietic stem\ncell transplant, she experienced prolonged menorrhagia requiring transfusions.\nSurgical therapy was contraindicated, and medical management was successful only \nwhen combined with balloon tamponade.\nCONCLUSION: Balloon tamponade may be a potentially life-saving adjunct to medical\ntherapy for control of uterine hemorrhage before hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplant.\n\nPMCID: PMC3798064\nPMID: 23344397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Results are conflicting as to whether there is a link between \nthe two. We describe three patients who experienced cerebral embolism during HRT.\nA 73-year-old woman had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 6 years prior to the\npresent admission. She then took HRT oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate\nfor about 6 years. The HRT had been prescribed by a gynaecologist for\namelioration of postmenopausal symptoms. Six years after beginning HRT, she\nexperienced sudden onset left hemiparesis due to cerebral embolism. Two other\npatients had been taking HRT for breast cancers. One, a 47-year-old woman, had\ntaken medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than one year, for recurrence of\nbreast cancer. She had developed sudden complete left hemiparesis due to an\nembolism at the carotid bifurcation. The other patient, a 72-year-old woman who\nwas taking tamoxifen citrate for prevention of breast cancer relapse, experienced\ncerebral embolism just 2 months after beginning tamoxifen. The risk of cerebral\nembolism in those on HRT should be emphasized, along with the beneficial effects \nin terms of postmenopausal symptoms and prevention of breast cancer recurrence.\n\nPMID: 11422601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient developed a lipoid\npneumonia with dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, radiographic infiltrates, and a pleural\neffusion. She was hospitalized for 4 days, and signs and symptoms resolved over 2\nweeks following steroids and supportive care.\nDISCUSSION: Experience with accidental or intentional intravenous lipid overdose \nin humans is limited. Typical findings of fat embolus syndrome are similar to\nlipid aspiration, with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltrates. \nIn contrast to aspiration, however, fat embolus syndrome results in\nlipogranulomas surrounding blood vessels, rather than air passages, and\npotentially produces cerebrovascular, accident-like symptoms. Management of fat\nembolus syndrome is similar to that for lipid aspiration. However, as seen in\nthis case, fat embolus syndrome typically resolves over several weeks as opposed \nto the 3-month to 1-year period seen with aspiration lipoid pneumonias.\nCONCLUSIONS: Accidental intravenous infusion of vegetable oil-based products is a\npotential complication of the increased use of intravenous progesterones.\n\nPMID: 9865244  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Since FDA approval\nfor contraceptive use in 1992, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)--already \nused by millions of women worldwide--has been used by several million U.S. women.\nAlthough women using this 3-month progestin-only injectable often experience\nirregular bleeding and spotting (initially), long-term DMPA use typically results\nin amenorrhea. Many users, including adolescents, choose DMPA because of its\nconvenience--nearly 100% contraceptive effectiveness is achieved with 4\ninjections per year. Because DMPA does not contain estrogen, it represents an\nappropriate contraceptive choice for postpartum or lactating women, as well as\nthose whose medical status precludes use of contraceptive doses of estrogen. Some\nexamples include: women over age 35 who smoke, those with increased\nthromboembolism risk, women with cardiovascular or liver disease, as well as\nwomen with complex migraines. Although fertility resumes on the average 10 months\nfollowing the last injection, suppression of ovulation occasionally persists for \nas long as 22 months. Consequently, DMPA is not an appropriate choice for women\nwho may wish to conceive within the next two years. Since the use of DMPA lowers \novarian estradiol production, reversible loss of bone mineral density (BMD) may\noccur. Studies currently in progress may clarify DMPA's long-term impact, if any,\non BMD. Therapeutic uses of DMPA include treatment of: dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia \n(including that associated with fibroid uterine tumors), endometriosis,\nendometrial hyperplasia, ovulatory pain, pain associated with ovarian adhesive\ndisease, premenstrual dysphoria and perimenopausal symptoms.\n\nPMID: 9609206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 49-year-old woman suffering from metastatic lung\ncarcinoma from breast carcinoma was administered MPA 1200 mg/day for about four\nmonths. Thereafter she complained of dizziness about two weeks but the general\npractitioners could detect no abnormality on physical examinations and on brain\nCT X-ray findings. Six days later, she died suddenly at her home. Forensic\nautopsy findings revealed the marked superior sagital sinus thrombosis and the\nmalignant lymphadenomatosis caused by metastatic lung carcinoma. As the patient\nhad not disease or trauma causing dural sinus thrombosis except for the\nadministration of MPA, we concluded that superior sagital sinus thrombosis was\ndue to the medication of MPA. This case illustrates that forensic pathologist\nshould consider the major side effect of some drugs like our case.\n\nPMID: 9545761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Despite presenting with stage IV disease, treated\nby surgery and medroxyprogesterone only, this patient has had an 8-year\ndisease-free remission, suggesting that radical debulking of an\nendocrine-responsive tumor may be of considerable benefit to some women with this\nunfavorable histological subtype of endometrial carcinoma.\n\nPMID: 8157198  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

After\nthe surgery, tamoxifen citrate (TAM) was orally administered in addition to\nvarious types of chemotherapy. Because the patient complained of nausea and\nweight loss, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) was orally administered instead of\nTAM. The patient complained of intense abdominal pain on the 35th day of\nadministration. Laparotomy was then performed for her acute abdominal problem.\nBecause necrosis from bleeding due to jejunal vein thrombosis was observed in the\njejunum for about 15 cm, resection of the jejunum was carried out. Histological\nobservation demonstrated thrombosis in the vein, and cellular infiltration around\nthe thrombosis. The postoperative prognosis has been favorable and the\npostoperative course is now being monitored at our clinic (2 months after\nsurgery). The patient has no complications such as diabetes mellitus or\nhypercholesterolemia. The thrombosis observed in the jejunal vein, which is a\nrare site for it on the 35th day of MPA administration was induced by MPA. Due\nattention must be paid to the formation of thrombosis when using MPA.\n\nPMID: 1444495  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient is a 64-year-old woman who\nhad been operated on for right breast cancer 22 years before. It was noticed that\nthere was a relapsing cancer on her right shoulder 6 months before this episode. \nAfter effective treatment of 5-FU, she had received 1,200mg of\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate and 30mg of Tamoxifen daily for 4 months. With the\ncomplaint of dyspnea and left leg swelling 4 months after above treatment, she\nwas admitted in our hospital. Laboratory data and angiograms showed venous\nthrombosis in her left leg and pulmonary embolism. Relapsing cancer had already\ndisappeared by the time she was admitted. After discontinuance of these\nmedicines, her condition had improved.

S"\n1. J Adolesc Health Care. 1983 Dec;4(4):257-60.\n\nChromosomally competent ovarian failure at adolescence.\n\nRauh JL, Waldrop CD, Burket RL.\n\nThree female adolescents are presented with delayed or incomplete secondary\nsexual development due to primary ovarian failure. All three patients had normal \nblood leukocyte and ovarian tissue karyotypes. The importance of performing a\ndiagnostic laparoscopy with ovarian biopsy in the setting of chromosome competent\novarian failure (CCOF) is emphasized.\n\nPIP: The cases are described of 3 female adolescents evaluated at the Cincinnati \nAdolescent Clinic for delayed or incomplete secondary sexual development due to\nprimary ovarian failure. All 3 patients had normal blood leukocyte and ovarian\ntissue karyotypes. The clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings are\ndiscussed with emphasis on distinguishing chromosome incompetent ovarian failure \n(CIOF-Turner's syndrome) from chromosome competent ovarian failure (CCOF). The\npatients included a 15 1/2 year old black female who sought evaluation of obesity\nand lethargy, a 17 1/2 year old white female with secondary amenorrhea in whom\noral provera failed to induce menstrual flow, and a 17 1/2 year old black female \nwith scanty, infrequent menses who achieved a normal amount and duration of\nmenstrual flow with Norinyl 1 + 80. Hypoestrogenization should be suspected in\ncases of incomplete breast development for age, thin vaginal mucosa with a\nprepubertal pattern of the vaginal cytology, scant cervical mucus without\nferning, and lack of withdrawal bleeding after progesterone administration. If\nany decrease in ovarian steroid production is clinically suspected in an\nadolescent with primary or secondary amenorrhea associated with delayed or\nincomplete puberty, serum gonadotropin levels should be measured. A single\nelevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the menopausal range is\ndiagnostic of primary ovarian failure in an adolescent. If the FSH is low or\nnormal, hypothalamic or pituitary disease would be suspected. A blood leukocyte\nkaryotype is the next diagnostic procedure for patients with primary ovarian\nfailure to distinguish between CCOF and CIOF. If the blood karyotype is XO or a\nvariant without a Y cell line, no further cytogenic workup or visualization of\nthe gonads is needed, but girls with blood karyotype of XX or a mosaic pattern\nwith 1 cell line with a Y chromosome should undergo laparoscopy and gonadal\nbiopsy. A unilateral testis should be removed to avoid malignant changes in later\nyears. Patients with CCOF may have other endocrine dysfunction, particularly\nautoimmune disease. Other possible diagnoses include resistant ovary syndrome,\npure gonadal dysgenesis, premature menopause, or infectious, chemical, or other\ncauses of ovarian failure. The incidence of CIOF is greater than that of CCOF\namong patients with primary ovarian failure. Optimal treatment requires medical\nand psychosocial intervention.\nPMID: 6315654  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The patient, a\n40-year old Chinese woman had smoked 30 cigarettes daily for many years. She\nreceived injections of 150 mg Depo-Provera in April and July 1979. 2 days after\nthe 2nd injection she was admitted to the hospital for vomiting and vertigo of 2 \ndays duration. Clinical examination showed a 12th nerve palsy with the tongue\ndeviated to the right but no other neurological abnormalities. She was treated\nsymptomatically with intravenous fluids and stemetil and improved. On the 5th day\nher vertigo and vomiting progressed and she developed more lower brain stem\nsigns. The same day she had a grand mal fit and went into a coma. She died on the\n7th hospital day. A partial autopsy limited to the skull revealed minimal\natherosclerosis of the vertebral artery but no thrombosis or occlusion. Cut\nsections after perfusion revealed an area of softening associated with some\nhemorrhage involving the whole length of the right half of the medulla oblongata \ndorsal to the olivary nucleus. Histological examination revealed an infarct\nundergoing liquefaction necrosis. The possibility of a causative relationship is \nsuggested by the development of tinnitis about 12 hours after injection of\nDepo-Provera.\nPMID: 6452693  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Five of the 7 patients were cases who had responded well\nto short-term ERT with 1.25 mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) for 6\nweeks. The 7 patients from 56 to 77 years of age received 0.625 mg/day of CEE for\n21 days, followed by a pause of 7 days. A 28-day cycle of low-dose ERT was\nperformed repeatedly. In 4 cases, these patients received 5 mg/day of\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) during the last 10-12 days of estrogen\ntreatment. Therapeutic efficacy of estrogen was evaluated by psychometric\nassessments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Hasegawa\nDementia Scale (HDS) and a behavior rating scale of the Gottfries-Br\xc3\xa5ne-Steen\ngeriatric rating scale (GBS). The MMSE and HDS evaluations were performed\nprincipally once in 2-4 weeks. In 4 out of the 7 patients, the MMSE and HDS\nscores were elevated above the pretreatment levels during ERT. The termination of\nERT resulted in a decrease in both scores. Furthermore, the GBS scores and daily \nactivities of the same 4 patients were improved during ERT. In these 4 patients\ncognitive functions were markedly improved throughout the treatment period, while\nthe other 2 patients responded moderately well and another patient did not\nrespond at all. These observations suggest that long-term, low-dose ERT improves \ncognitive functions, dementia symptoms and daily activities in women with mild to\nmoderate DAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 7606287  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It occurs in women of childbearing age, as episodes of pain in the\ndistribution of the sciatic nerve, which present in a cyclic manner and coincide \nwith menstruation. If it is not treated, a sensomotor mononeuropathy of the\nsciatic nerve develops.\nCLINICAL CASE: The patient had complained of right-sided sciatic pain from the\nage of 36 years. Over the years a motor deficit had slowly and progressively\nappeared causing foot drop. The painful crises were related to her menstrual\nperiods. At the age of 44 years a pyramidal muscle syndrome was diagnosed and\ntreated surgically. This was followed by increase in the crises of sciatic pain. \nA year later, she started to have sciatic pain on the left side, which was\nsimilar to that of the right side. The clinical, imaging and electrophysiological\nfindings are reported. The patient improved. She is still being treated with\ndepot medroxyprogesterone and her pain has disappeared.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cyclical sciatica due to endometriosis is little known and may lead \nto permanent disability. Computerized axial tomography of the pelvis using\ncontrast material is very useful for diagnosis. The use of depot\nmedroxyprogesterone seems to be a satisfactory treatment in some patients.\n\nPMID: 10528307  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'
