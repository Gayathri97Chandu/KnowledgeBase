This folder contains the RxCUIs of 268 drugs from RxNorm: tempRXCuiMappings_pipe.txt

format:
RxCUI|drugname


Number of lines:
$ cat tempRXCUIMappings_pipe.txt | wc -l
268


drugMappings.txt is the raw output obtained by from the TRIADs drug
named entity recognition program
(https://swat-4-med-safety.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/u-of-pitt-SPL-drug-NER). The
file contains 268 unique RxNorm drugs and RxCUIs.  $ cat
drugMappings.txt | grep RXNORM | cut -f 1,2 -d ' '| uniq | wc -l 268

Unique MeSH drugs were 269:
$ cat drugMappings.txt | grep MESH | cut -f 1,2 -d ' '| uniq | wc -l
269

Only one missing RxNorm that is in MeSH:
N-(3-amino-1-(cyclobutylmethyl)-2,3-dioxopropyl)-3-(2-((((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)carbonyl)amino)-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-azabicyclo(3.1.0)hexan-2-carboxamide

drugMappings was first put into tempRXCUIMappings.txt:
cat drugMappings.txt | grep RXNORM | cut -f 1,2 -d ' '| uniq | cut -f 6 -d '/' > tempRXCUIMappings.txt

Then it was pipe deliminated to tempRXCUIMappings_pipe.txt:
$ tr ' ' '|' <tempRXCUIMappings.txt >tempRXCUIMapping_pipe.txt

for the mesh mappings...
cat drugMappings.txt | grep MESH | cut -f 1,2 -d ' '| uniq | cut -f 6 -d '/' | tr ' ' '|' > tempMESHMappings.txt

Take note....
These files are deprecated except drugMappings.txt. This is because this is space delimited and sometimes more than one word explained
a drug in drugMappings.txt. I just had the processEuSPCTo....py to parse the drugMappings.txt.
