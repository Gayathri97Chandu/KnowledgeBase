KnowledgeBase (TODO: find a character or concept from Greek Mythology to name this by)
=============

Source code used to develop the OHDSI knowledge base (KB) of sources with
information relevant for assessing assocations between drugs and
health outcomes of interest. Please see the following publication for
a description of the goal and use cases driving the KB's development:

Boyce. RD., Ryan. PB., Noren. N., et al., Bridging islands of information to establish an integrated knowledge base of drugs and health outcomes of interest. Drug Safety. 2014. Volume 37, Issue 8 (2014), Page 557-567. DOI: 10.1007/s40264-014-0189-0, PubMed PMID: 24985530. PMCID: PMC4134480.http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40264-014-0189-0. 

The project is laid out as described below. Please see README files in
