S'\n1. Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Oct;25(8):631-7.\n\nRelative bioavailability and bioequivalence of a newly developed fixed\ncombination sachet of acetylsalicylic acid and pseudoephedrine compared with a\npreliminary combination.\n\nL\xc3\xbccker PW(1), Birkel M, Hey B, Loose I, Schaefer A.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Institut fur Klinische Pharmakologie Bobenheim, Prof. Dr. Lucker GmbH,\nRichard-Wagner-Strasse 20, 67269 Gr\xc3\xbcnstadt, Germany.\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and pseudoephedrine (PSE) are often administered\ntogether for the treatment of symptoms of the common cold, i.e., nasal\ncongestion, runny nose, sore throat and headache. Based on this fact we developed\na fixed combination of 500 mg ASA and 30 mg PSE, the recommended doses for both\ndrugs for treating symptoms of the common cold, as granulate to be dissolved in\nwater for administration. The purpose of this open, randomized, three-factorial\n(three-treatment, three-period, six-sequence) Latin Square clinical study was to \ninvestigate the relative bioavailability of ASA and PSE as well as the\nestablishment of bioequivalence after single administration of the fixed\ncombination (final formulation for approval) of 500 mg ASA/30 mg PSE*HCl and the \npreliminary formulation of this combination. Pharmacokinetic characteristics\nAUC(norm) and C(max,norm) of ASA, its metabolite SA, and PSE, were determined as \nmeasure of rate and extent of absorption of the two formulations. The treatment\nratios final/preliminary formulation and their corresponding 90% confidence\nintervals were calculated to establish bioequivalence. Additionally, descriptive \nstatistics were calculated for the parameters t(max), t((1/2)), and mean\nresidence time (MRT). In total, data from 18 healthy male volunteers were\nincluded in the pharmacokinetic evaluation. The primary target parameters were\nanalyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) after logarithmic transformation\nof the data. Confidence intervals of 90% were calculated for the geometric means \nof ratios using the mean square error term of the ANOVA. Bioequivalence criteria \nwere fulfilled for AUC(norm) and C(max,norm). Geometric means of individual\nratios of AUC(norm) and of C(max,norm) showed equal bioavailability of the new\nformulation compared with the preliminary. Furthermore, a relative\nbioavailability of approximately 100% of the preliminary formulation was shown\nfor the newly developed formulation for all parameters. The parameters t(max),\nt((1/2)), and MRT showed comparable results for ASA, SA, and PSE, respectively,\nin both formulations. The supplementary evaluation for the non-normalized\noriginal parameters AUC and C(max) also revealed bioequivalence. For the newly\ndeveloped formulation, the arithmetic means of the parameters AUC and C(max) for \nPSE were 1040.66 mg/h*l and 134.52 mg/l, for SA 142.28 mg/h*l and 30.34 mg/l,\nrespectively. The median t(max) values were 0.67 h for PSE and 0.92 h for SA.\nBoth treatments were safe and well tolerated.\n\n(c) 2003 Prous Science.

Patients with early RA (symptom duration <1 \nyear) were recruited from 15 rheumatology clinics in Sweden from October 1, 2002,\nthrough December 31, 2005. The study population was restricted to working-age\npatients (aged <63 years).\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients who did not achieve low disease activity after 3 to 4\nmonths of methotrexate therapy were randomized to receive additional biological\ntreatment with infliximab or conventional combination treatment with\nsulfasalazine\xe2\x80\x89plus\xe2\x80\x89hydroxychloroquine.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly sick leave and disability pension days 21\nmonths after randomization retrieved from the nationwide Swedish Social Insurance\nOffice register. Main analyses were by intention to treat, including all\npatients, and adjusted for baseline sick leave and disability pension.\nRESULTS: Of 204 eligible patients, 105 were randomized to biological and 99 to\nconventional treatment. Seven patients in the biological and 4 in the\nconventional treatment group never received the study drug, and 72 and 52\npatients, respectively, followed the study per protocol for 21 months. The\nbaseline mean (SD) work loss was 17 (13) d/mo (median, 16 d/mo) in both groups\n(mean difference, 0.6 d/mo; 95% CI, -3.0 to 3.9). The mean changes in work loss\nat 21 months were -4.9 d/mo in the biological and -6.2 d/mo in the conventional\ntreatment group (adjusted mean difference, 1.6 d/mo; 95% CI, -1.2 to 4.4).\nIncluding only patients receiving at least 1 dose of assigned treatment, the\nadjusted mean difference was 1.5 d/mo (95% CI, -1.5 to 4.4), and in per-protocol \nanalysis the adjusted mean difference was 0.3 d/mo (95% CI, -2.8 to 3.8).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The radiological superiority of biological compared\nwith conventional combination therapy did not translate into better work loss\noutcomes in patients with early RA who had experienced an insufficient response\nto methotrexate.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00764725.\n\nPMID: 23817631  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients who did not have an improvement at 24\nweeks according to a prespecified threshold were switched in a blinded fashion to\nthe other therapy. The primary outcome was improvement in the Disease Activity\nScore for 28-joint counts (DAS28, with scores ranging from 2 to 10 and higher\nscores indicating more disease activity) at week 48.\nRESULTS: Both groups had significant improvement over the course of the first 24 \nweeks (P=0.001 for the comparison with baseline). A total of 27% of participants \nin each group required a switch in treatment at 24 weeks. Participants in both\ngroups who switched therapies had improvement after switching (P<0.001), and the \nresponse after switching did not differ significantly between the two groups\n(P=0.08). The change between baseline and 48 weeks in the DAS28 was similar in\nthe two groups (-2.1 with triple therapy and -2.3 with etanercept and\nmethotrexate, P=0.26); triple therapy was noninferior to etanercept and\nmethotrexate, since the 95% upper confidence limit of 0.41 for the difference in \nchange in DAS28 was below the margin for noninferiority of 0.6 (P=0.002). There\nwere no significant between-group differences in secondary outcomes, including\nradiographic progression, pain, and health-related quality of life, or in major\nadverse events associated with the medications.\nCONCLUSIONS: With respect to clinical benefit, triple therapy, with sulfasalazine\nand hydroxychloroquine added to methotrexate, was noninferior to etanercept plus \nmethotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had active disease despite\nmethotrexate therapy.

The purpose\nof this study was to examine outcomes of a blinded trial of initial MTX\nmonotherapy with the option to step-up to combination therapy as compared to\nimmediate combination therapy in patients with early, poor-prognosis RA.\nMETHODS: In the Treatment of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) trial, 755\nparticipants with early, poor-prognosis RA were randomized to receive MTX\nmonotherapy or combination therapy (MTX plus etanercept or MTX plus sulfasalazine\nplus hydroxychloroquine). Participants randomized to receive MTX monotherapy\nstepped-up to combination therapy at 24 weeks if the Disease Activity Score in 28\njoints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) was \xe2\x89\xa53.2.\nRESULTS: Attrition at 24 weeks was similar in the MTX monotherapy and combination\ngroups. Of the 370 evaluable participants in the initial MTX group, 28% achieved \nlow levels of disease activity and did not step-up to combination therapy (MTX\nmonotherapy group). The mean \xc2\xb1 SD DAS28-ESR in participants continuing to take\nMTX monotherapy at week 102 was 2.7 \xc2\xb1 1.2, which is similar to that in\nparticipants who were randomized to immediate combination therapy (2.9 \xc2\xb1 1.2).\nParticipants who received MTX monotherapy had less radiographic progression at\nweek 102 as compared to those who received immediate combination therapy (mean \xc2\xb1 \nSD change in modified Sharp score 0.2 \xc2\xb1 1.1 versus 1.1 \xc2\xb1 6.4). Participants\nassigned to initial MTX who required step-up to combination therapy at 24 weeks\n(72%) demonstrated similar DAS28-ESR values (3.5 \xc2\xb1 1.3 versus 3.2 \xc2\xb1 1.3 at week\n48) and radiographic progression (change in modified Sharp score 1.2 \xc2\xb1 4.1 versus\n1.1 \xc2\xb1 6.4 at week 102) as those assigned to immediate combination therapy. The\nresults for either of the immediate combination approaches, whether triple\ntherapy or MTX plus etanercept, were similar.\nCONCLUSION: These results in patients with early, poor prognosis RA validate the \nstrategy of starting with MTX monotherapy. This study is the first to demonstrate\nin a blinded trial that initial MTX monotherapy with the option to step-up to\ncombination therapy results in similar outcomes to immediate combination therapy.\nApproximately 30% of patients will not need combination therapy, and the 70% who \nwill need it are clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from those who\nwere randomized to receive immediate combination therapy.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nPMID: 23686414  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2013 Apr 15.\n\nClinical response within 12 weeks as a predictor of future low disease activity\nin patients with early RA: results from the TEAR Trial.\n\nCurtis JR(1), McVie T, Mikuls TR, Reynolds RJ, Navarro-Mill\xc3\xa1n I, O'Dell J,\nMoreland LW, Bridges SL Jr, Ranganath VK, Cofield SS.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)From the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.\njcuirtis@uab.edu\n\nOBJECTIVE: Rapidly predicting future outcomes based on short-term clinical\nresponse would be helpful to optimize rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management in\nearly disease. Our aim was to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule to\npredict low disease activity (LDA) at 1 year among patients participating in the \nTreatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) trial escalating RA\ntherapy by adding either etanercept or sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine [triple\ntherapy (TT)] after 6 months of methotrexate (MTX) therapy.\nMETHODS: Eligible subjects included in the derivation cohort (used for model\nbuilding, n = 186) were participants with moderate or higher disease activity\n[Disease Activity Score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS-ESR) > 3.2]\ndespite 24 weeks of MTX monotherapy who added either etanercept or sulfasalazine \n+ hydroxychloroquine. Clinical characteristics measured within the next 12 weeks \nwere used to predict LDA 1 year later using multivariable logistic regression.\nValidation was performed in the cohort of TEAR patients randomized to initially\nreceive either MTX + etanercept or TT.\nRESULTS: The derivation cohort yielded 3 prediction models of varying complexity \nthat included age, DAS28 at various timepoints, body mass index, and ESR (area\nunder the receiver-operator characteristic curve up to 0.83). Accuracy of the\nprediction models ranged between 80% and 95% in both derivation and validation\ncohorts, depending on the complexity of the model and the cutpoints chosen for\nresponse and nonresponse. About 80% of patients could be predicted to be\nresponders or nonresponders at Week 12.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical data collected early after starting or escalating\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug/biologic treatment could accurately predict \nLDA at 1 year in patients with early RA. For patients predicted to be\nnonresponders, treatment could be changed at 12 weeks to optimize outcomes.\n\nPMCID: PMC3694569\nPMID: 23588939  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

After 3-4\xe2\x80\x89months, patients with\nDAS28\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x893.2 were randomized to add sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (triple\ntherapy) or infliximab (MTX\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89INF). Those with DAS28 \xe2\x89\xa43.2 were followed in\nregular care. Radiographic progression over 24\xe2\x80\x89months was scored according to the\nSharp van der Heijde score (SHS) and defined as >5 increase in T-SHS over\n24\xe2\x80\x89months. Hand bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by DXR at inclusion and\n12\xe2\x80\x89months and a change \xe2\x89\xa52.5\xe2\x80\x89mg/cm2/month was used as a cut-off for HBL.\nRESULTS: In the MTX responders, triple therapy, and MTX\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89INF groups, the\nproportions with HBL were 4.1%, 22.2% and 16.4%, respectively (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01), and the\nmean (SD) radiological progression in these groups was 3.91 (6.72), 7.40 (14.63) \nand 2.72 (4.55) respectively (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.06). Patients with HBL had significantly\ngreater risk for radiographic progression, compared with patients without HBL\n(odds ratio 3.09, 95% CI =1.20-7.79, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Non-responders to MTX had a significantly greater risk of HBL than\nMTX-responders, despite the add-on therapies. Patients with HBL during the\n12\xe2\x80\x89months had greater risk of radiographic progression after 24\xe2\x80\x89months.\nEvaluation of HBL may help to identify patients who are at risk of radiographic\nprogression.\n\nPMCID: PMC3599105\nPMID: 23497111  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The observed increases were 31.4 mg/dl, 28.7 mg/dl, and 30\nmg/dl in LDL cholesterol, 19.3 mg/dl, 22.3 mg/dl, and 20.6 mg/dl in HDL\ncholesterol, and 56.8 mg/dl, 53 mg/dl, and 57.3 mg/dl in total cholesterol (P <\n0.0001 versus baseline for each comparison). There was a statistically\nsignificant decrease in the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol at 24\nweeks in all 3 treatment groups versus baseline. There was no difference in any\nlipid changes between the 3 treatment arms. After multivariable adjustment,\nchange in C-reactive protein, but not the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints,\nwas associated with change in LDL cholesterol (P = 0.03) and total cholesterol (P\n= 0.01). Baseline glucocorticoid use was associated with changes in HDL\ncholesterol (P = 0.03) and total cholesterol (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSION: Levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol\nincreased comparably shortly after initiation of MTX plus etanercept, triple\ntherapy, and MTX monotherapy among patients with early RA with active disease\nparticipating in a clinical trial. The clinical relevance of short-term changes\nin traditional lipids on cardiovascular outcomes remains to be determined.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nPMCID: PMC3672346\nPMID: 23460074  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

However, little is known about the way rheumatologists in Latin \nAmerica treat their patients in clinical practice, outside the scope of clinical \ntrials.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe treatment patterns at\ndisease onset in early RA with data from a large, multicenter, multinational\ninception cohort of Latin American patients.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients with early RA (<1 year of disease duration as\ndiagnosed by a rheumatologist) from 46 centers in 14 Latin American countries\nwere enrolled in the study. Clinical data, laboratory assessments, and a detailed\nregistry on type of prescriptions were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18,\nand 24 months of follow-up. Hands and feet x-rays were obtained at baseline and\nat 12 and 24 months. All data were captured in Arthros 6.1 database. Continuous\nvariables were expressed as means and SDs, and categorical variables were\nexpressed as percentages and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Only therapeutic\ndata at baseline are presented, corresponding to the period between disease onset\nand second visit (3 months).\nRESULTS: A total of 1093 patients were included. Eighty-five percent were female,\nand 76% had a positive rheumatoid factor. Mean age at diagnosis was 46.5 (SD,\n14.2) years, and mean disease duration at the first visit was 5.8 (SD, 3.8)\nmonths. Between baseline and second visit (3 months), 75% of patients (95% CI,\n72%-78%) received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Methotrexate (MTX) alone\nor in combination was the most frequently used (60.5%), followed by antimalarials\n(chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, 32.1%), sulfasalazine (7.1%), and leflunomide\n(LEF, 4%). In 474 patients (43%), initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs was within the first month after the first visit. In addition, 290 patients\n(26%; 95% CI, 23%-29%) received combination therapy as initial treatment. The\nmost frequently used combinations were MTX + chloroquine (45%), MTX +\nhydroxychloroquine (25%), and MTX + sulfasalazine (16%). Eleven patients (1%; 95%\nCI, 0.5%-1.8%) received biologics. Sixty-four percent (95% CI, 60%-66%) received \ncorticosteroids. Of those, 80% (95% CI, 77%-84%) received 10 mg of oral\nprednisone or less.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of Latin American patients with early RA, most\npatients received MTX very early in their disease course. Combination therapy was\nused approximately in 1 of every 4 patients as initial therapy. Biologics were\nrarely used at this early stage, and low-dose prednisone was commonly used.\n\nPMID: 23047532  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

RA is associated with an increased left ventricular mass index\n(LVMI), a strong marker of cardiovascular mortality, and vessel abnormalities.\nExperimental studies have suggested that tumour necrosis factor \xce\xb1 (TNF\xce\xb1) may\ninduce LV hypertrophy.\nOBJECTIVE: To study the effect of medium-term (3- and 6-months) treatment with\nthe TNF\xce\xb1 inhibitor etanercept (ETN) and synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs (sDMARDs) on LV morphological features and arterial stiffness in patients\nwith RA.\nMETHODS: Consecutive female patients with active RA requiring treatment with ETN \n(n=28) or sDMARDs (n=20) were included. Clinical and biological monitoring,\nechocardiography and pulse wave velocity (PWV) assessment were performed at\ninclusion and at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Paired t tests and \nmultivariate linear regression analysis were used.\nRESULTS: Mean LVMI tended to be higher at baseline in the ETN group than in the\nsDMARD group (96.5\xc2\xb119.8 vs 84.3\xc2\xb126.8 g/m2; p=0.11 for the ETN and sDMARD groups, \nrespectively). In patients with ETN treatment, mean LVMI was significantly\ndecreased at 3 and 6 months (-6.3\xc2\xb17.6 and -14.2\xc2\xb19.3 g/m2; p<0.001), with no\nchange from baseline for patients with sDMARD treatment (-2.2\xc2\xb110.9 and -2.7\xc2\xb110.2 \ng/m2, respectively). Blood pressure (BP) and aortic PWV were not changed by\neither treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: ETN induced a significant decrease in LVMI with medium-term\ntreatment with no change in BP or PWV. TNF\xce\xb1 may be an important factor of LV\nhypertrophy, which may explain the benefit of TNF inhibitors on cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality in RA. These results need to be confirmed by larger\nstudies and with other TNF inhibitors.\n\nPMID: 22872022  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A study was undertaken to determine whether infliximab (INFL) added \nto intensified FIN-RACo treatment for the initial 6 months improves the 2-year\noutcome.\nMETHODS: 99 patients with early untreated active RA were enrolled in an\ninvestigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group\ntrial. Primary outcomes were remission and radiological changes at 2 years. All\npatients started with FIN-RACo. In addition, they were randomised to receive INFL\nor placebo (Pla) from weeks 4 to 26.\nRESULTS: At 24 months, 66% and 53%, respectively, of the patients in the\nFIN-RACo+INFL and FIN-RACo+Pla groups were in remission according to the modified\nAmerican College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (p=0.19), 26% and 10% were in\nsustained modified ACR remission (p=0.042) and 82% in both groups were in\nremission by 28-joint disease activity score (not significant).

Recent studies have suggested that cigarette smoking\nmay lead to lower treatment response rates with methotrexate (MTX) and some\nbiologic agents in RA. Knowledge of whether tobacco exposure reduces treatment\nefficacy is important, since smoking could represent a modifiable factor in\noptimizing RA treatment.\nMETHODS: The study participants included patients with early RA (<3 years in\nduration) enrolled in the Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis\nstudy, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing early\nintensive therapy (MTX + etanercept or MTX + hydroxychloroquine + sulfasalazine\ntriple therapy) versus initial treatment with MTX with step-up to MTX +\netanercept or to triple therapy if the disease was still active at 24 weeks.\nSerum cotinine was measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay at baseline and at 48 weeks, with detectable concentrations\nat both visits serving as an indicator of smoking status. The mean Disease\nActivity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) was compared by smoking status, adjusting for\nbaseline disease activity.\nRESULTS: Of the 412 subjects included in the analysis, 293 (71%) were categorized\nas nonsmokers and 119 (29%) as current smokers. There were no differences in the \nmean DAS28 score between 48 and 102 weeks based on smoking status for the overall\ngroup (P = 0.881) or by specific treatment assignment.\nCONCLUSION: Among patients enrolled in a large randomized controlled trial of\nearly RA with poor prognostic factors, smoking status did not impact treatment\nresponses for those receiving early combination or initial MTX with step-up\ntherapy at 24 weeks if the disease was still active.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 by the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nPMCID: PMC3467327\nPMID: 22730343  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Patients were included who had a high \nprobability (>70%) of progressing to persistent arthritis, based on the\nprediction model of Visser. Patients were randomised into three induction therapy\nstrategies: (A) combination therapy (methotrexate (MTX) + sulfasalazine +\nhydroxychloroquine) with GCs intramuscularly; (B) combination therapy with an\noral GC tapering scheme and (C) MTX with oral GCs similar to B. A total of 281\npatients were randomly assigned to strategy (A) (n=91), (B) (n=93) or (C) (n=97).\nRESULTS: The Disease Activity Score (DAS) after 3 months was lower in patients\nreceiving initial combination therapy than in those receiving MTX monotherapy\n(0.39 (0.67 to 0.11, 95% CI)). DAS did not differ between the different GC\nbridging treatments. After 3 months 50% fewer biological agents were prescribed\nin the combination therapy groups. Although the proportion of patients with\nmedication adjustments differed significantly between the treatment arms, no\ndifferences were seen in these adjustments due to adverse events after\nstratification for drug.\nCONCLUSION: Triple DMARD induction therapy is better than MTX monotherapy in\nearly RA. Furthermore, no differences were seen in medication adjustments due to \nadverse events after stratification for drug. Intramuscular and oral GCs are\nequally effective as bridging treatments and both can be used.\n\nPMID: 22679301  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 2 \xc3\x97 2 factorial design was used to\nrandomly assign subjects to 1 of 4 treatment arms: immediate treatment with MTX\nplus etanercept, immediate oral triple therapy (MTX plus sulfasalazine plus\nhydroxychloroquine), or step-up from MTX monotherapy to one of the combination\ntherapies (MTX plus etanercept or MTX plus sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine)\nat week 24 if the DAS28-ESR was \xe2\x89\xa5 3.2. All treatment arms included matching\nplacebos. The primary outcome was an observed-group analysis of DAS28-ESR values \nfrom week 48 to week 102.\nRESULTS: At week 24 (beginning of the step-up period), subjects in the 2\nimmediate-treatment groups demonstrated a greater reduction in the DAS28-ESR\ncompared with those in the 2 step-up groups (3.6 versus 4.2; P < 0.0001); no\ndifferences between the combination-therapy regimens were observed. Between week \n48 and week 102, subjects randomized to the step-up arms had a DAS28-ESR clinical\nresponse that was not different from that of subjects who initially received\ncombination therapy, regardless of the treatment arm. There was no significant\ndifference in the DAS28-ESR between subjects randomized to oral triple therapy\nand those randomized to receive MTX plus etanercept. By week 102, there was a\nstatistically significant difference in the change in radiographic measurements\nfrom baseline between the group receiving MTX plus etanercept and the group\nreceiving oral triple therapy (0.64 versus 1.69; P = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION: There were no differences in the mean DAS28-ESR during weeks 48-102\nbetween subjects randomized to receive MTX plus etanercept and those randomized\nto triple therapy, regardless of whether they received immediate combination\ntreatment or step-up from MTX monotherapy. At 102 weeks, immediate combination\ntreatment with either strategy was more effective than MTX monotherapy prior to\nthe initiation of step-up therapy. Initial use of MTX monotherapy with the\naddition of sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine (or etanercept, if necessary,\nafter 6 months) is a reasonable therapeutic strategy for patients with early RA. \nTreatment with the combination of MTX plus etanercept resulted in a statistically\nsignificant radiographic benefit compared with oral triple therapy.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 by the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nPMCID: PMC4036119\nPMID: 22508468  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Here we report the 2 year follow-up assessment.\nMETHODS: In this randomised, non-blinded, parallel-group trial, we enrolled adult\npatients older than 18 years with rheumatoid arthritis and a symptom duration of \nless than 1 year from 15 rheumatology units in Sweden between December, 2002 and \nDecember, 2006. All patients were started on methotrexate. After 3-4 months,\nthose who failed treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to group A (conventional \ntreatment; additional sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) or group B\n(biological treatment; additional infliximab). Randomisation was done with a\ncomputer-generated sequence. We analysed clinical outcomes at months 18 and 24 by\nthe response criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and the European\nLeague Against Rheumatism, and radiographs of patients' hands and feet at months \n12 and 24 using the Van der Heijde modification of the Sharp score. Analysis was \nby intention to treat. This trial is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov,\nnumber NCT00764725.\nFINDINGS: Of 493 screened individuals, we enrolled 487, of whom 258 were randomly\nallocated to treatment. The proportion of patients in group B who received a\nEULAR-defined good response was non-significantly greater than it was in group A \nat 18 months (49 of 128 [38%] vs 38 of 130 [29%]) and at 24 months (49 of 128\n[38%] vs 40 of 130 [31%]; p=0\xc2\xb7204). After 24 months, radiological disease\nprogression was greater in patients in group A than it was in those in group B\n(mean 7\xc2\xb723 [SD 12\xc2\xb772] vs 4\xc2\xb700 [10\xc2\xb70]; p=0\xc2\xb7009). We recorded three serious adverse\nevents: an extended generalised illness in group A, an extended febrile episode\nin group B, and a generalised illness in group B.\nINTERPRETATION: Additional biological treatment is a valid option for patients\nwho fail initial methotrexate treatment. However, improved clinical outcomes\nafter 12 months and better radiographical results after 24 months should be\nweighed against the absence of a convincing clinical difference at 24 months and \nsubstantially higher costs. Therefore, for many patients who fail initial\nmethotrexate treatment, add-on treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs is an appropriate treatment option.\nFUNDING: Swedish Rheumatism Association, Stockholm County, and\nSchering-Plough/Merck Sharp and Dohme.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Three- and 6-month effectiveness was compared by\nunadjusted analysis and with adjustment for propensity score quintile. In\naddition, effectiveness in SSZ- and MTX-treated patients matched for RF status\nand baseline DAS-28 was compared.\nRESULTS: SSZ-treated patients (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89175) had lower baseline disease activity than \npatients treated with MTX (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89927) [mean 28-joint DAS (DAS-28) 4.4 vs 5.0,\nP\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001], and were less often RF positive (50 vs 61%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.006). Six-month\nmean \xce\x94DAS-28 was smaller with SSZ than MTX (-1.0 vs -1.5, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.003); the\ndifference was not significant after adjustment for propensity score quintile\n(P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.36). For SSZ/MTX, 3-month ACR50 and European League Against Rheumatism\n(EULAR) good responses were 9/23% (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) and 24/31% (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.14),\nrespectively. Three-year drug survival was superior for MTX (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) and\nestimated 1-year survival rates were 42/75% for SSZ/MTX. In patients matched for \nbaseline DAS-28 and RF, mean \xce\x94DAS-28 (MTX -1.2, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.55 vs SSZ) and EULAR good\nresponses (39 vs 37%, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.74) were similar at 6 months; drug survival was\nsuperior for MTX (P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001).\nCONCLUSION: Patients treated with SSZ as first DMARD were more often RF negative \nand had lower baseline disease activity. Drug survival was superior for MTX, and \neffectiveness was greater with MTX than with SSZ although the difference was\nreduced when adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics.\n\nPMID: 22157597  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Targets were DAS28 less than 2.6 for the D group,\nMMP-3 normalisation for the M group and both DAS28 less than 2.6 and MMP-3\nnormalisation for the T group. If the value in question did not fall below the\npreviously measured level, medication was intensified, including methotrexate,\nother disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biological agents. Primary,\nsecondary and outcome measures consisted of the proportions of patients showing\nclinical remission (DAS28 <2.6), radiographic non-progression (\xce\x94modified total\nSharp score \xe2\x89\xa40.5), normal physical function (modified health assessment\nquestionnaire score 0), or comprehensive disease remission defined as the\ncombination of clinical remission, radiographic non-progression and normal\nphysical function.\nRESULTS: Clinical remission at 56 weeks was achieved by more patients in the T\ngroup (56%) than in the R group (p<0.0005) or M group (p<0.0005).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results of the T-4 Study reveal that a twin target strategy can\nachieve a high clinical remission rate in early RA.\n\nPMID: 22021897  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

European League Against\nRheumatism (EULAR) response, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), rheumatoid\nfactor (RF), and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) were\nrecorded at study start and at 3, 6, and 12 months.\nRESULTS: In total, 180 RA patients (11%) had disease duration \xe2\x89\xa4 12 weeks. These\npatients achieved good EULAR response significantly more often at 3 and 12 months\nthan patients with a longer disease duration despite having more aggressive\ndisease [EULAR good response was achieved by 35% and 35% at 3 and 12 months,\nrespectively, among the patients with disease duration \xe2\x89\xa4 12 weeks, by 35% and 41%\nof patients with disease duration of 13-24 weeks, and by 28% and 33% of patients \nwith disease duration of 25-52 weeks (p = 0.02 for 3 months; p = 0.02 for 12\nmonths)]. There was a significant correlation between improvement in Disease\nActivity Score-28 (DAS28), its individual variables, and Health Assessment\nQuestionnaire (HAQ) and disease duration up to 12 months after study start. For\nsmokers, no such trend was seen.\nCONCLUSION: Up to 12 months after inclusion in the study, there was a significant\ncorrelation between improvement in DAS28, its individual components, and HAQ and \ndisease duration, with patients who had a shorter disease duration improving\nmost. Smokers had poorer EULAR response and showed no improvement with regard to \ndisease duration.\n\nPMID: 21807778  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Data pertaining to tongue coating and\ntongue body color were collected. In order to simplify the tongue diagnosis for\neasily understood by biomedical professionals, only two typical tongue coating\n(white and yellow) and four typical tongue body colors (purple, pink, pale and\nred) were identified for this analysis. 170 cases with clear tongue coating and\n198 cases with clear tongue body color in TCM treatment (Glucosidorum Tripterygll\nTotorum tablets and Yishen Juanbi tablets) group, 181 cases with identified\ntongue coating and 189 cases with identified tongue body color in WM treatment\n(diclofenec, methotrexate and sulfasalazine) group were included for the\nanalysis. The ACR20 response at 12 weeks and 24 weeks were used as an outcome\nmeasure of efficacy. The effective rates in patients with different tongue\nappearances were analyzed with Chi-square method and the association between the \nchanges of tongue coating/body color and the ACR20 response was analyzed with a\nrepeated measures logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: At 12 weeks, the ACR20 responses in the patients treated with CM and WM \ntherapy were 33.6% and 53.0%, respectively, and at 24 weeks, they were 57.9% and \n84.3%, respectively. RA patients with white tongue coating showed higher\neffective rate than those patients with yellow tongue coating in the treatment\nwith WM intervention (p<0.05), and there was no difference in the patients with\nCM intervention. Further association analysis showed that TCM would be less\neffective for the patients with pale tongue body (p=0.0323), and WM would be less\neffective for the patients with purple or red tongue body (p=0.0291 and 0.0027,\nrespectively).\nCONCLUSION: TCM was less effective for the patients with pale tongue body, and WM\nwas be less effective for the patients with purple or red tongue body, or white\ntongue coating. The results suggest that tongue coating and body color might be\nused to help identify a subset of RA patients both for CM and WM interventions.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

After 2\nyears, the use of DMARDs and prednisolone became unrestricted. Radiographic\nprogression in hands and feet was assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5\nyears. ACPAs at baseline were determined with enzyme immunoassay.\nRESULTS: ACPAs were positive in 92 (71%) patients. ACPA-positive vs. negative\npatients were more frequently rheumatoid factor (RF) positive (83% vs. 22%,\np<0.001) and had an erosive disease (54% vs. 22%, p<0.001) at baseline. The\npresence of ACPA was associated with radiographic progression in FIN-RACo group\neven when the impact of RF was controlled; the radiographic progression was\nremarkably slower in ACPA-negative than in ACPA-positive cases (RF adjusted\nchange over time between groups p=0.034). In the SINGLE group, the radiographic\nchanges progressed parallel in ACPA-negative and positive patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most ACPA-positive RA patients have joint erosions already at\ndiagnosis. ACPA positivity in early RA was related to radiographic progression\neven in patients treated initially with the FIN-RACo regimen. The initial\nFIN-RACo therapy seems to slow down the progression of joint damage in\nACPA-negative patients.\n\nPMID: 21640044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Three\nalternative strategies were compared for treating recent-onset polyarticular JIA.\nMETHODS: In a 54-week multicentre open-label clinical trial, 60 disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naive patients aged 4-15 years were randomly assigned \ninto three treatment arms. The efficacy of infliximab plus methotrexate (TNF) was\ncompared to that of two synthetic therapies: methotrexate alone (MTX) and DMARD\nmethotrexate, sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine in combination (COMBO).\nPrimary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology paediatric 75% improvement \n(ACR Pedi 75). Secondary endpoints were inactive disease and safety.\nRESULTS: In 59 patients, mean (\xc2\xb1SE) age at baseline was 9.6\xc2\xb10.4 years, duration\nof JIA 1.9\xc2\xb10.2 months and number of active joints 18\xc2\xb11. ACR Pedi 75 was achieved \nin 100% (19/19) of patients receiving TNF, 65% (13/20) on COMBO (95% CI 44% to\n86%) and 50% (10/20) on methotrexate (95% CI 28% to 72%) p<0.0001. Thirteen\npatients receiving TNF (68%; 95% CI 47% to 89%) achieved inactive disease,\nwhereas eight (40%; 95% CI 22% to 63%) on COMBO and five (25%; 95% CI 6% to 44%) \non methotrexate did (p=0.002). Patients on TNF spent a mean 26 weeks (95% CI 18\nto 34) with inactive disease, longer than did those receiving COMBO (13 weeks;\n95% CI 6 to 20), or methotrexate (6 weeks; 95% CI 2 to 10). Serious adverse\nevents were rare.\nCONCLUSION: In early polyarticular JIA, targeting to achieve minimally active or \ninactive disease, infliximab plus methotrexate was superior to synthetic DMARD in\ncombination and strikingly superior to methotrexate alone.\n\nPMID: 21623000  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A total of 123 patients\nwere randomized to the tacrolimus group (61 patients) and to the placebo group\n(62 patients). In the tacrolimus group, 70.5% achieved a clinical response\naccording to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 criteria, whereas 45.2% in\nthe placebo group did so (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.005). The tacrolimus group also showed\nsignificant improvement in terms of the European League Against Rheumatism\n(EULAR) response criteria of "good or moderate" versus the placebo group (86.9\nvs. 56.5%, respectively). Likewise, significantly more patients in the tacrolimus\ngroup versus the placebo group achieved remission of the Disease Activity Score\nin 28 joints (DAS28) (45 vs. 21%). The mean changes in the Total Sharp Score and \nerosion score were lower in the tacrolimus group, but the differences between the\ntwo groups were not significant. There was no significant difference between the \ntwo groups in the incidence of adverse events. Based on these results, we can\nconclude that the additional use of tacrolimus in patients with early rheumatoid \narthritis with inadequate response to other DMARD treatments is useful, and this \ncould become one of the treatment options for these rheumatoid arthritis\npatients.\n\nPMID: 21347803  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The purpose of the present study was \nto evaluate whether anti-TNF treatment in early RA has an impact on body\ncomposition and BMD besides that which could be achieved by intensive\ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) combination therapy.\nMETHODS: Forty patients with early RA who failed treatment with methotrexate up\nto 20 mg/week for 3 months were randomised to addition of sulphasalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine (treatment A) or addition of infliximab (treatment B). At 3,\n12 and 24 months, body composition and BMD were assessed by total-body\ndual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. At the same time points, leptin, adiponectin,\napolipoproteins, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and markers of bone\nremodelling were analysed. Compliance to treatment was considered in the\nanalyses. Data were analysed with a mixed, linear model.\nRESULTS: Patients treated with anti-TNF had a significant increase in fat mass at\n2 years, 3.8 (1.6 to 5.9) kg, in contrast to patients in treatment A, 0.4 (-1.5\nto 2.2) kg (P = 0.040), despite similar reduction in disease activity. Both\ntreatment strategies prevented loss of muscle mass and bone. Leptin\nconcentrations increased significantly in both groups at 2 years and adiponectin \nincreased significantly at 2 years in treatment A and at 1 year in treatment B.\nThere were no significant changes in apolipoproteins or IGF-1. The markers of\nbone resorption decreased at 12 months in both treatment groups with no\nsignificant difference between the treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy increased body fat mass, an effect that was not\nachieved with the combination of DMARDs, despite a similar reduction in disease\nactivity, and thus seemed to be drug specific. The increase of fat mass was not\nassociated with an exacerbated atherogenic lipid profile. Leptin and adiponectin \nconcentrations increased in both treatment groups. The increase of adiponectin\nmay partially explain the reduced frequency of cardiovascular diseases found when\ndisease activity is reduced in RA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN39045408.\n\nPMCID: PMC2991034\nPMID: 20964833  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The aim of \nthis study was to evaluate the radiologic progression beyond that time in\npatients with early RA initially treated with a combination of three\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or a single DMARD.\nMETHODS: A cohort of 199 patients with early active RA were initially randomized \nto receive treatment with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and\nhydroxychloroquine with prednisolone (FIN-RACo), or treatment with a single DMARD\n(initially, sulfasalazine) with or without prednisolone (SINGLE). After 2 years, \nthe drug-treatment strategy became unrestricted, but still targeted remission.\nThe radiographs of hands and feet were analyzed by using the Larsen score at\nbaseline, 2, 5, and 11 years, and the radiographs of large joints, at 11 years.\nRESULTS: Sixty-five patients in the FIN-RACo and 65 in the SINGLE group had\nradiographs of hands and feet available at baseline and at 11 years. The mean\nchange from baseline to 11 years in Larsen score was 17 (95% CI, 12 to 26) in the\nFIN-RACo group and 27 (95% CI, 22 to 33) in the SINGLE group (P=0.037).

Joint damage in\nhands and feet were scored in random order according to the Sharp-van der Heijde \nmethod at baseline and yearly up to 4 years.\nRESULTS: 68% of the patients had accelerated hand BMD loss (>-0.003 g/cm2) in the\nfirst year of RA. Hand BMD loss was associated with progressive joint damage\nafter 1 year both in hands and feet with odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence\nintervals [CI]) of 5.3 (1.3-20.9) and 3.1 (1.0-9.7). In univariate analysis, hand\nBMD loss in the first year was a predictor of subsequent progressive total joint \ndamage after 4 years with an OR (95% CI) of 3.1 (1.3-7.6). Multivariate analysis \nshowed that only progressive joint damage in the first year and\nanti-citrullinated protein antibody positivity were independent predictors of\nlong-term progressive joint damage.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the first year of RA, accelerated hand BMD loss is associated\nwith progressive joint damage in both hands and feet.

The presence of the probiotic bacteria in the feces of patients was \ninvestigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).\nRESULTS: Adverse events recorded were three instances of gastrointestinal\ndisturbance and one flare of RA. Plasma and urinary levels of SSZ and its\nmetabolites showed no statistically significant changes after probiotic\nadministration and the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance did not appear\nto be ascribed to higher sulfapyridine plasma levels.

Studies \non the effects of exogenous estrogens in RA patients have yielded contradictory\nresults. We undertook this study to determine the effects of the selective\nestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) agonist Org 37663 in patients with RA, in terms\nof both its estrogenic effects and its ability to ameliorate disease activity.\nMETHODS: A 10-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,\nparallel group, dose-finding, proof-of-concept trial was initiated to obtain data\non the efficacy and safety of Org 37663 in postmenopausal female patients with RA\nwho were receiving background treatment with either methotrexate or\nsulfasalazine. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or Org 37663 at doses \nof 4 mg/day, 15 mg/day, or 50 mg/week. The primary efficacy variable was the\nDisease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28).\nRESULTS: Org 37663 induced a clear biologic, estrogenic response in several organ\nsystems, including a dose-related increase in levels of sex hormone binding\nglobulin. However, the DAS28 decreased similarly for all treatment groups\nincluding placebo, indicating lack of clinical efficacy of Org 37663 in this\ntrial.\nCONCLUSION: The observed lack of clinical benefit in RA patients treated with an \nERalpha agonist, in association with a clear biologic response to the study drug,\nprovides evidence that a biologically relevant ERalpha-mediated estrogenic effect\nis not associated with a clinically relevant effect on RA symptoms and signs.\n\nPMID: 20112368  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A computer-generated code with random,\npermuted blocks was used to assign treatment.\nSETTING: 2 U.S. academic centers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,\nMaryland, and University of Texas, Dallas, Texas) and 9 rheumatology subspecialty\nclinics (in Dallas and Austin, Texas; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Florida;\nArlington, Virginia; Duncanville, Pennsylvania; Wheaton and Greenbelt, Maryland; \nand Lansing, Michigan).\nPATIENTS: 121 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and 6 or more painful and\nswollen joints.\nINTERVENTION: TwHF extract, 60 mg 3 times daily, or sulfasalazine, 1 g twice\ndaily. Patients could continue stable doses of oral prednisone or nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs but had to stop taking disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs at least 28 days before randomization.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the rate of achievement of 20% improvement \nin the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR 20) at 24 weeks. Secondary \nend points were safety; radiographic scores of joint damage; and serum levels of \ninterleukin-6, cholesterol, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone.\nRESULTS: Outcome data were available for only 62 patients at 24 weeks. In a\nmixed-model analysis that imputed data for patients who dropped out, 65.0% (95%\nCI, 51.6% to 76.9%) of the TwHF group and 32.8% (CI, 21.3% to 46.0%) of the\nsulfasalazine group met the ACR 20 response criteria (P=0.001). Patients\nreceiving TwHF also had significantly higher response rates for ACR 50 and ACR 70\nin mixed-model analyses. Analyses of only completers showed similar significant\ndifferences between the treatment groups. Significant improvement was\ndemonstrated in all individual components of the ACR response, including the\nHealth Assessment Questionnaire disability score. Interleukin-6 levels rapidly\nand significantly decreased in the TwHF group. Although not statistically\nsignificant, radiographic progression was lower in the TwHF group. The frequency \nof adverse events was similar in both groups. Limitations: Only 62% and 41% of\npatients continued receiving TwHF extract and sulfasalazine, respectively, during\nthe 24 weeks of the study. Long-term outcome data were not collected on\nparticipants who discontinued treatment.\nCONCLUSION: In patients who continued treatment for 24 weeks and could also use\nstable oral prednisone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, attainment of\nthe ACR 20 response criteria was significantly greater with TwHF extract than\nwith sulfasalazine.\n\nPMCID: PMC2938780\nPMID: 19687490  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We aimed to compare addition of conventional disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drugs (sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) with addition of a\ntumour necrosis factor antagonist (infliximab) to methotrexate in patients with\nearly rheumatoid arthritis.\nMETHODS: We undertook a randomised trial in 15 rheumatology units in Sweden. We\nenrolled patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (symptom duration <1 year) and \nadministered methotrexate (up to 20 mg per week). After 3-4 months, those who had\nnot achieved low disease activity but who could tolerate methotrexate were\nrandomly allocated by computer addition of either sulfasalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine or infliximab. Primary outcome was achievement of a good\nresponse according to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at 12\nmonths. Patients were followed up to 24 months; here, we present findings at 12\nmonths. Analysis was by intention to treat and we used non-responder imputation. \nThe Swefot (Swedish Pharmacotherapy) study is registered in the WHO database at\nthe Karolinska University Hospital, number CT20080004.\nFINDINGS: 487 patients were initially enrolled. Of 258 who had not achieved low\ndisease activity with methotrexate, 130 were allocated sulfasalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine and 128 were assigned infliximab. 32 of 130 (25%) patients\nallocated sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine achieved the primary outcome\ncompared with 50 of 128 (39%) assigned infliximab (risk ratio 1.59 [95% CI\n1.10-2.30], p=0.0160). Adverse events were balanced fairly well between the two\ngroups and accorded with known adverse events of the drugs used. No deaths\noccurred in either group.\nINTERPRETATION: In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate \ntreatment failed, addition of a tumour necrosis factor antagonist to methotrexate\nmonotherapy is clinically superior to addition of conventional disease-modifying \nantirheumatic drugs.\nFUNDING: Swedish Rheumatism Association, Schering-Plough.\n\nPMID: 19665644  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

LSchipper@reuma.umcn.nl\n\nOBJECTIVES: MTX, either alone or in combination with SSZ, is effective in the\ntreatment of RA. Trials have shown that, after SSZ failure, the addition of MTX\nto SSZ is more effective than a switch to MTX. Whether this is also the case in\ndaily practice has not been analysed yet. In this study, we compared the efficacy\nof a switch to MTX monotherapy with that of the addition of MTX to SSZ in the\ndaily clinical practice of RA patients who had failed SSZ monotherapy in the\nNijmegen RA Inception Cohort.\nMETHODS: For this study, 230 patients who failed to SSZ monotherapy were followed\nfor up to 52 weeks. A total of 124 underwent a switch to MTX alone, whereas 106\npatients received the combination of MTX and SSZ. The primary outcome measure was\nthe mean change in the disease activity score (DAS28) after 24 weeks.\nRESULTS: Both treatment groups showed a significant decrease in DAS28 after 24\nweeks, which was similar in both groups. Drug survival analysis showed that the\nchance to stop with a DMARD within 52 weeks was higher in the MTX-SSZ group (P\n<0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: In RA patients who failed to SSZ the clinical efficacy of a switch\nto MTX monotherapy was similar to that of the addition of MTX, suggesting that in\ndaily clinical practice a switch to MTX is a good option for patients with an\ninadequate response to SSZ.\n\nPMID: 19638454  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

L.vanTuyl@vumc.nl\n\nOBJECTIVE: COBRA combination therapy is well known and has uncontested efficacy\nin the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is infrequently\napplied in Dutch clinical practice. Based on qualitative research on opinions of \nphysicians and patients towards COBRA therapy, our study describes the\ndevelopment and pilot testing of an implementation package to facilitate\nprescription and use of COBRA therapy in early RA.\nMETHODS: The implementation package was developed to address specific barriers\ntowards prescription of COBRA therapy and comprised informational handouts (an\ninformation booklet and leaflet for patients), preprinted prescription orders,\nand background information on COBRA therapy for the rheumatologists. Twenty-two\nrheumatologists agreed to participate, including the arthritis nurse where\navailable. Rheumatologists, nurses, and patients were asked to record their\nexperience. All Dutch arthritis nurses were invited to an educational session on \nCOBRA therapy.\nRESULTS: Sixteen rheumatologists accompanied by 10 arthritis nurses used the\nmaterial to prescribe COBRA therapy to a total of 27 patients. Rheumatologists\nand nurses both gave high marks to the supplied materials. Eighty-eight percent\nof rheumatologists reported that the material sped up the prescription process,\nand 65% indicated they would prescribe COBRA therapy more frequently if these\nmaterials were available routinely. Patients expressed great satisfaction with\nthe information handouts, rating it 2.8 (standard deviation 0.5) on a scale of -3\n(very negative) to +3 (very positive). Most patients (89%) planned to keep the\ninformation booklet as a reference and 70% used it as a tool to remember the\ncorrect intake of medication. The attitude and perceived capability of nurses\ntowards the guidance of patients with RA receiving COBRA therapy was improved\nthrough a brief educational intervention.\nCONCLUSION: Rheumatologists, patients, and arthritis nurses all highly\nappreciated the implementation package and indicated that its availability would \nincrease uptake of COBRA therapy.\n\nPMID: 19487259  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

L.vantuyl@vumc.nl\n\nBACKGROUND: COBRA (for 'COmbinatie therapie Bij Rheumatoide Artritis')\ncombination therapy is effective for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), \nbut long-term safety is unknown. This study evaluates survival, comorbidities and\njoint damage in the original COBRA trial cohort.\nMETHODS: In the COBRA trial, 155 patients with early RA were treated with\nsulfasalazine (SSZ) monotherapy (SSZ group) or a combination of step-down\nprednisolone, methotrexate (MTX) and SSZ (COBRA group). The current 11-year\nfollow-up study of the COBRA trial invited all original patients and performed\nprotocollised scrutiny of clinical records, questionnaires, physical examination,\nlaboratory and imaging tests.\nRESULTS: In all, 152 out of 155 patients yielded at least partial data. After a\nmean of 11 years follow-up, 18 (12%) patients had died, 6 COBRA patients and 12\nSSZ patients, HR 0.57 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.52). Treatment for hypertension was\nsignificantly more prevalent in the COBRA group (p=0.02) with similar trends for \ndiabetes and cataract. Conversely, hypercholesterolaemia, cancer and infection\nshowed a trend in favour of COBRA. Other comorbidities such as cardiovascular\ndisease and fractures appeared in similar frequency. Radiographic findings\nsuggest as a minimum sustained benefit for COBRA therapy, that is, difference in \njoint damage but similar subsequent progression rates after 5 years. Imputation\nto compensate for selective dropout suggests increasing benefit for COBRA, that\nis, difference in yearly progression rates similar to that seen in the first 5\nyears of follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: After 11 years, initial COBRA combination therapy resulted in\nnumerically lower mortality and similar prevalence of comorbidity compared with\ninitial SSZ monotherapy. In addition, lower progression of joint damage suggests \nlong-term disease modification.\n\nPMID: 19451137  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

After 2 years, the drug treatment\nstrategy became unrestricted, but still targeted remission. At 11 years, function\nwas assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and clinical\noutcomes were assessed with the modified Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) measure\nand the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for remission.\nRESULTS: At 11 years, 138 patients were assessed (68 in the combination-DMARD\ngroup and 70 in the single-DMARD group). The mean+/-SD HAQ scores were\n0.34+/-0.54 in the combination-DMARD group and 0.38+/-0.58 in the single-DMARD\ngroup (P=0.88). Modified MDA was achieved by 63% (95% confidence interval [95%\nCI] 51, 77) and by 43% (95% CI 32, 55) (P=0.016) of the combination-DMARD group\nand the single-DMARD group, respectively, and ACR remission by 37% (95% CI 26,\n49) and by 19% (95% CI 11, 29) (P=0.017), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Initial therapy with a combination of DMARDs in early RA results in\nhigher rates of patients achieving modified MDA and strict ACR remission even\nover the long term than initial single-DMARD therapy. Targeting remission with\ntight clinical controls results in good functional and clinical outcomes in most \nRA patients.\n\nPMID: 19404945  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, it has not been used\nglobally. In the present study, we compared the timing of onset of efficacy and\nthe usefulness of this drug with that of the globally accepted agent\nsalazosulfapyridine (SASP). There were 26 patients in the Buc group and 23 in the\nSASP group. We compared changes in the number of swollen joints, number of\npainful joints, duration of morning stiffness, grip strength, levels of\ninflammatory marker [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein \n(CRP)], rheumatoid factor (RF), physician's rating by visual analogue scale\n(VAS), patient's rating of pain, patient's overall rating (VAS), and improvement \naccording to European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria (DAS28-CRP,\nDAS28-ESR) in these two groups of patients. Both Buc and SASP were shown to be\nefficacious within 3 months after the start of treatment. Both drugs were found\nto be suitable as first-line treatment of early RA.

Patients of control group were \ntreated with oral administration of Methotrexate (MTX, 7.5 mg/w), Sulfasalazine\n(0.5 g,t. i.d.), Meloxicam (Mobic,7. 5 mg, b. i. d.); and those of bee-venom\ngroup treated with Bee-sting of Ashi-points and the above-mentioned Western\nmedicines. Ashi-points were selected according to the position of RA and used as \nthe main acupoints, supplemented with other acupoints according to syndrome\ndifferentiation. The treatment was given once every other day and all the\ntreatments lasted for 3 months.\nRESULTS: Compared with pre-treatment, scores of joint swelling degree, joint\nactivity, pain, and pressing pain, joint-swelling number, grasp force, 15\nm-walking duration, morning stiff duration in bee-venom group and medication\ngroup were improved significantly (P<0.05, 0.01). Comparison between two groups\nshowed that after the therapy, scores of joint swelling, pain and pressing pain, \njoint-swelling number and morning stiff duration, and the doses of the\nadministered MTX and Mobic in bee-venom group were all significantly lower than\nthose in medication group (P<0.05, 0.01); whereas the grasp force in been-venom\ngroup was markedly higher than that in medication group (P<0.05). In addition,\nthe relapse rate of bee-venom group was obviously lower than that of medication\ngroup (P<0.05; 12% vs 32%).\nCONCLUSION: Combined application of bee-venom therapy and medication is superior \nto simple use of medication in relieving RA, and when bee-sting therapy used, the\ncommonly-taken doses of western medicines may be reduced, and the relapse rate\ngets lower.\n\nPMID: 18807725  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy was highest with sulfasalazine\n(26 (52%) vs 6 (6%) for either etanercept group, p<0.001). Patients receiving\netanercept or etanercept plus sulfasalazine had a more rapid initial response,\nwhich was sustained at 2 years, than those receiving sulfasalazine: mean DAS 2.8,\n2.5 versus 4.5, respectively (p<0.05); ACR 20 response was achieved by 67%, 77%\nversus 34% of patients, respectively (p<0.01) Overall, PRO followed a similar\npattern; a clinically significant improvement in health assessment questionnaire \nwas achieved by 76%, 78% versus 40% of patients, respectively (p<0.01). Commonly \nreported adverse events occurring in the etanercept groups were injection site\nreactions and pharyngitis/laryngitis (p<0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Etanercept and etanercept plus sulfasalazine are efficacious for the \nlong-term management of patients with RA. The addition of etanercept or\nsubstitution with etanercept should be considered as treatment options for\npatients not adequately responding to sulfasalazine.\n\nPMCID: PMC2689524\nPMID: 18794178  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A pilot randomized controlled trial comparing\nadherence and satisfaction.\n\nHomer D(1), Nightingale P, Jobanputra P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, Selly Oak Hospital, University Hospital Birmingham\nNHS Foundation Trust, UK. dawn.homer@uhb.nhs.uk\n\nBACKGROUND: Communicating information about disease-modifying anti-rheumatic\ndrugs (DMARDs) before patients start treatment is a key role for some\nrheumatology clinical nurse specialists. This is done in our unit to promote\nunderstanding of the risks and benefits of drug therapy and encourage timely and \nreliable use of DMARDs. Information is routinely provided individually but this\ncan lead to delays in starting treatment because of limited nursing resources. In\nthis randomized trial we tested the feasibility of giving patients, who were\nabout to start on a DMARD, information about the drug in groups and compared this\nwith information given individually.\nMETHODS: Adults with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic\narthritis who were referred to the nursing team for counselling about starting on\nmethotrexate, sulfasalazine or leflunomide were included. Patients who had\npreviously taken a DMARD were not excluded and those consenting were randomized\nto receive drug information individually or in groups (of three to six patients).\nWe provided all patients with written materials about the relevant drug and\ndiscussed the risks and benefits of drug use verbally. Patients allocated to\ngroup counselling received this intervention in a teaching room, with a slide\npresentation. The primary outcome was adherence with medication use, ascertained \nby pill counts, self-report diaries and prescription dispensation. Secondary\noutcomes included satisfaction with information about medicines (SIMS) by\nquestionnaire; time taken to provide information; adherence to scheduled hospital\nappointments and blood monitoring schedules; and DMARD continuation rates at four\nand twelve months.\nRESULTS: Of 127 eligible patients referred for counselling about DMARDs, 62\nconsented to take part: 32 were randomized to receive drug information\nindividually and 30 to receiving it in groups. Patients allocated to the two\ndifferent interventions were comparable for age and diagnoses at baseline but\nmore patients allocated individual counselling had not taken a DMARD previously: \n56% (18/32) versus 20% (6/30). More patients counselled in groups were adherent\n(27/30; 90%) compared with patients counselled individually (22/32; 69%; p =\n0.06) by pill counts. However, on self-report diaries, similar proportions were\nadherent (group counselling 97% (29/30) versus individual 94% (30/32); p = 1.0). \nAll but two prescriptions were dispensed. More patients allocated to individual\ncounselling missed at least one blood monitoring visit (25% versus 17%; p = 0.54)\nand at least one scheduled clinic visit (19% versus 3%; p = 0.10). SIMS scores\nindicated high levels of patient satisfaction and were similar for both groups.\nThe time taken to run group and individual counselling sessions were similar\n(median of 35 minutes versus 33 minutes, respectively). Nursing time per\nindividual patient in those allocated group counselling was 11.6 minutes. Drug\ncontinuation rates were higher for those counselled in groups compared with those\ncounselled individually: at four months, 73% versus 63 %; p = 0.42; at twelve\nmonths, 47% versus 38%; p = 0.61).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of providing\ncounselling on DMARDs to groups of patients with important time savings for\nspecialist nurses and while maintaining high levels of patient satisfaction.\nThere was a trend for better outcomes in terms of adherence and drug continuation\nrates for patients counselled in groups, indicating potential benefits from group\ninteractions. However, these findings need to be investigated further in a\nlarger, fully powered trial.\n\n2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nPMID: 18792423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Treatment was adjusted based on\n3-monthly disease activity score (DAS) assessments, aiming at a DAS < or =2.4.\nFrom the third year, patients with a sustained DAS <1.6 discontinued treatment.\nRESULTS: In total, 43% of patients were in remission (DAS <1.6) at 4 years and\n13% were in drug-free remission: 14%, 12%, 8% and 18% of patients in groups 1-4, \nrespectively. The absence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, male\ngender and short symptom duration were independently associated with drug-free\nremission. Functional ability and remission were maintained in all four groups\nwith the continuation of DAS-driven treatment, without significant differences\nbetween the groups. Significant progression of joint damage was observed in 38%\nand 31% of patients in groups 3 and 4 versus 51% and 54% of patients in groups 1 \nand 2 (p<0.05, group 4 versus groups 1 and 2, group 3 versus group 2).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent-onset active RA, drug-free remission was\nachieved in up to 18% of patients. DAS-driven treatment maintained clinical and\nfunctional improvement, independent of the treatment strategy. Joint damage\nprogression remained significantly lower after initial combination therapy\ncompared with initial monotherapy.\n\nPMID: 18662933  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

CM therapy included Glucosidorum\nTripterygll Totorum tablet and Yishen Juanbi Tablet. The WM therapy included\nvoltaren extended action tablet, methotrexate and sulfasalazine. The American\nCollege of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50 and 70 responses were employed as primary\nend-point analysis and the 18 symptoms as secondary end-point analysis. All data \nwere analyzed on SPSS11.5 statistical package.\nRESULTS: The ACR20 and ACR50 responses in WM were higher than in CM group, but\nmore improvement on the symptoms and less adverse events were observed in CM\ntherapy. The 18 CM symptoms in RA could be grouped into four symptom combinations\nwith factor analysis method. The factor loading value difference (which reflects \nthe degree of improvement) in responded cases was lower than in non-responded\ncases in the symptom combination 1. The loading value difference in both\nresponded and non-responded cases in CM treated patients were higher than those\nin WM treated group in the symptom combination 2 and 3.\nCONCLUSIONS: WM combined therapy was more effective in the treatment of RA in\nACR20 evaluation, but more improvement on CM symptoms were seen in the CM\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 18638711  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

L.vantuyl@vumc.nl\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and feasibility of an intensive\ncombination treatment in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) combined with monitoring\nboth disease activity and cartilage degradation.\nMETHODS: In a pilot trial, 21 patients with active early RA (mean DAS28 5.3; mean\ndisease duration 3 months) were treated with COBRA treatment comprising\nsulfasalazine, methotrexate and high-dose step-down prednisolone, intensified by \nadding hydroxychloroquine and continued low-dose prednisolone. In addition, based\non measurements of disease activity or a marker of cartilage degradation\n(CTX-II), treatment adjustments were possible with methotrexate intensification\nafter 8 or 21 weeks; and with infliximab after 21 weeks.\nRESULTS: Nineteen of 21 patients (90%) were in remission (DAS28 <2.6) after 40\nweeks (8 weeks, 57%; 21 weeks, 76%). American College of Rheumatology (ACR)\ncriteria, ACR20, 50, 70 and 90 improvements rates were 100%, 95%, 71% and 43%\nrespectively. CTX-II excretion decreased by mean (SD) 347(292) ng/mmol\ncreatinine, but only 50% of patients reduced their CTX-II excretion below the\ncut-off point. The two monitoring groups showed no significant difference in\nremission according to DAS score or CTX-II excretion, despite a trend towards\nmore intensive treatment in the CTX-II group. Treatment intensification was\nfeasible according to protocol.\nCONCLUSIONS: This small pilot study suggests that intensified and tightly\ncontrolled COBRA treatment is uniquely effective in early RA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN96372677.\n\nPMID: 18625629  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

SSZ was given in a dose of 2.0 g/day,\nHCQ--200 mg/day. A MTX dose was gradually increased from 7.5 mg/week to 17.5\nmg/week in an attempt to achieve remission in all the patients. Basic criterion\nof the treatment efficacy was achievement of a significant clinical effect (> 50%\nresponse according to the American College of Rheumatology--ACR criteria) in\nstability of the positive effect beginning from the ninth month of the study up\nto its end with no evidence of serious drug toxicity.\nRESULTS: 13 of 18 patients treated with the triple therapy (72.2%) and 6 of 20\npatients treated with MTX alone (30.0%; p = 0.013) achieved an ACR > 50% response\nby the end of 18 months of therapy. 11 of 18 patients (61.1%) from the combined\ntherapy group and 5 of 20 patients (25%; p = 0.024) from MTX monotherapy group\nmaintained ACR > 50% response from month 9 to 18 of the study without any\nevidence of major drug toxicity. Two patients (11.1%) in the combined therapy\ngroup and 4 patients (20%) in the MTX group discontinued the treatment because of\ndrug toxicity.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with RA the triple combination therapy with MTX, SSZ and \nHCQ given during 1.5 year is more effective than MTX alone. The triple\ncombination of MTX, SSZ and HCQ is well tolerated.\n\nPMID: 18590110  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We undertook\nthis study to test the hypothesis that early parallel triple therapy achieves\nbetter outcomes than step-up therapy within an intensive disease management\nregimen.\nMETHODS: Ninety-six patients with early RA (mean disease duration 11.5 months)\nwere randomized to receive step-up therapy (sulfasalazine [SSZ] monotherapy, then\nafter 3 months, methotrexate [MTX] was added, and when the maximum tolerated\ndosage of MTX was reached, hydroxychloroquine [HCQ] was added) or parallel triple\ntherapy (SSZ/MTX/HCQ). All patients were assessed monthly for 12 months. If their\ndisease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) was > or =3.2, the dosage of DMARDs\nwas increased according to protocol, and swollen joints were injected with\ntriamcinolone acetonide (maximum dosage 80 mg per month). A metrologist who was\nblinded to the treatment allocation performed assessments every 3 months. The\nprimary outcome measure was the mean decrease in the DAS28 score at 12 months.\nRESULTS: Both groups showed substantial improvements in disease activity and\nfunctional outcome. At 12 months, the mean decrease in the DAS28 score was -4.0\n(step-up therapy group) versus -3.3 (parallel therapy group) (P = 0.163). No\nsignificant differences in the percentages of patients with DAS28 remission\n(step-up therapy group 45% versus parallel triple therapy group 33%), DAS28 good \nresponse (60% versus 41%, respectively), or American College of Rheumatology\ncriteria for 20% improvement (ACR20) (77% versus 76%, respectively), ACR50 (60%\nversus 51%, respectively), or ACR70 (30% versus 20%, respectively) responses were\nseen. Radiologic progression was similar in both groups.\nCONCLUSION: This study confirms that highly effective control of disease activity\ncan be achieved using conventional DMARDs as part of an intensive disease\nmanagement strategy. Within this setting, step-up therapy is at least as\neffective as parallel triple therapy.\n\nPMID: 18438851  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to\npredict progressive disease (increase of Sharp/van der Heijde score over 2 years \nbeyond the smallest detectable change [4.6]) according to the presence or absence\nof the shared epitope (SE), DERAA, RF, and ACPA, with correction for other\nbaseline characteristics.\nRESULTS: Progressive disease could not be predicted by presence of the SE: the\nodds ratio in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, was 1.4, 2.6, 1.9, and 3.0.\nDERAA carriership did not protect against progressive disease (odds ratio 0.4,\n1.4, 0.9, and 0.9 in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). RF positivity and ACPA\npositivity predicted progressive disease in group 1 (odds ratio 4.7 [95%\nconfidence interval 1.5-14.5] for RF and 12.6 [95% confidence interval 3.0-51.9] \nfor ACPA), but not in groups 2-4 (for RF, odds ratio [95% confidence interval]\n1.5 [0.5-4.9], 1.0 [0.3-3.3], and 1.4 [0.4-4.8] in group 2, group 3, and group 4,\nrespectively; for ACPA, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.4 [0.8-14.2], 1.7 \n[0.5-5.4], and 1.8 [0.5-6.8] in group 2, group 3, and group 4).\nCONCLUSION: In patients with early RA treated with the goal of tight control of\nthe DAS, no significant association between HLA-DRB1 status and radiographic\nprogression was found. RF and ACPA were predictive of progressive disease only in\npatients treated with sequential monotherapy. These observations suggest that\neffective treatment can prevent radiographic progression, even in patients with\nrisk factors for severe damage.\n\nPMID: 18438829  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria were used\nfor efficacy evaluation. All data were analyzed using the SPSS11.5 statistical\npackage.\nRESULTS: ACR20 and 50 responses with WM treatment were higher at 24 weeks than in\nthe TCM group. In the WM group, 89% achieved ACR20 whereas 65.8% on TCM reached\nthis response In the WM group, efficacy was negatively related to subjective\nsymptoms of dizziness, and positively related to joint tenderness and thirst as\nrecorded at entry. In contrast, in the TCM group the efficacy was positively\nrelated to joint tenderness and joint pain, and negatively related to the joint\nstiffness and more nocturia.\nCONCLUSION: Symptoms including those not directly related to joints and those\ninquired about in TCM may have influence on the efficacy of therapy, and might\nmerit further study to ascertain if they can be helpful to guide specific\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 18176139  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Radiographic evaluation of the hands and feet was\nperformed at 0 and 24 months.\nRESULTS: Significant correlations (r = 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.45) were found between\nIL-1beta levels measured at 0 and 6 months. The IL-1beta levels at 0 months\ncorrelated significantly (r = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03-0.4, p= 0.021) with the baseline \nnumber of eroded joints at 0 months but not with radiographic joint damage at 24 \nmonths. The baseline level of IL-1beta was a better indicator for the presence of\neroded joints than the baseline level of serum CRP. No significant changes in\nIL-1beta levels were observed during the first 6 months of anti-rheumatic\ntreatment in either group. No statistically significant difference between\nIL-1beta levels in the patients with or without the shared epitope could be\nobserved.\nCONCLUSIONS: The serum IL-1beta level is significantly associated with the\npresence of erosions at the onset of RA but its predictive value is attenuated or\nlost when single or combination DMARD medication is instituted. Measuring\nIL-1beta at the time of diagnosis in a single patient cannot be used to estimate \nthe erosive nature of the disease or the prognosis.\n\nPMID: 18078614  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Step-down patients received a modified\ncombination therapy in early RA (COBRA) regimen: sulphasalazine (SPS), 2 g daily,\nand methotrexate (MTX), 15 mg weekly, combined with step-down oral prednisolone\n(start 60 mg daily, fast tapering to 7.5 mg over 6 weeks, discontinuation from\nweek 28). At week 40, patients were randomized to maintenance therapy with either\nSPS or MTX if disease activity score-28 (DAS28) was acceptably low. The step-up\ngroup started disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) monotherapy. In both \ngroups, treatment was adjusted at follow-up, based on DAS28. DAS28, functionality\nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), adverse events, DMARD changes and steroid \nuse were registered 4-monthly for 2 yrs.\nRESULTS: Nineteen patients received step-down and 52 step-up treatment. More\npatients completed the first year without unplanned DMARD changes and without\ndosage adjustment and fewer had DMARD changes due to side effects or inefficacy\nin the step-down group compared with step-up, whereas the number of adverse\nevents was comparable. MTX proved to be the most effective maintenance therapy\nafter step-down. The DAS response, proportion of patients in remission, HAQ\nresponse and proportion of patients without disability at 4 months was higher in \nthe step-down group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In daily practice, a step-down treatment strategy for early RA is\nmore effective than a step-up approach.\n\nPMID: 18039681  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This was proposed to be more likely to be helpful for \nrheumatoid arthritis than standard plasma exchange.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) in\nthe treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.\nMETHODS: Eighty-two patients were randomly assigned, 42 to the DFPP group and 40 \nto the no-DFPP group. All patients received sulfasalazine (0.75 g 3 times daily) \nplus methotrexate (10 mg orally once weekly). All patients had been on stable\ndoses for more than 3 months. DFPP was performed once a week for 2 to 3 sessions.\nA total of 121 plasmapheresis procedures were performed in 42 patients. Control\npatients did not receive sham DFPP. The efficacy measures recorded 1 day after\nthe final treatment and every month in follow-up for 4 to 22 months included the \nAmerican College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20%, 50%, and 70% improvement criteria\n(ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70), the Health Assessment Questionnaire estimate of\ndisability and the disease activity index.\nRESULTS: Patients in the DFPP group had ACR20, ACR 50, and ACR70 improvements\nimmediately after the last treatment of 100%, 92.9%, and 81.0%, when compared\nwith the patients in no-DFPP group 17.5%, 0%, and 0% (P < 0.001). Significant\nchange from baseline was observed in Health Assessment Questionnaire scores in\nthe DFPP group, but not in the no-DFPP group (P < 0.001). The changes from\nbaseline in the disease activity scores were significantly greater than in the\nno-DFPP group (P < 0.001). Improvements were maintained during follow-up of 7 to \n22 months.\nCONCLUSION: This open trial showed that DFPP therapy significantly altered the\nsigns and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis. There were increases in\nphysical function and improvement in quality of life. This is proposed as an\napproach that merits further investigation.\n\nPMID: 17762452  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In the follow-up assessment, variables of the\nAmerican College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 (ACR Pedi 30) criteria were\ncollected. The assessor was blinded to trial treatment allocation.\nRESULTS: After the trial, patients had been routinely followed in rheumatology\nreferral centres, and treated at the discretion of the attending physician.\nAlmost all patients continued or started disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs\n(DMARDs) (SSZ 91%, PLAC 93%; SSZ treatment in about 80%). DMARD treatment\nappeared less intensive in the SSZ group as evidenced by a significantly shorter \nduration of SSZ use (median 2.5 vs 5.2 years; p = 0.02) and a trend towards less \nuse of methotrexate and other DMARDs. More than one-third of the patients\nreported long periods of non-compliance with DMARD treatment in both groups. At\nfollow-up, 74% of the patients had active joints, and 30% showed active\npolyarthritis. Almost all outcome scores were better for SSZ compared with PLAC\npatients. Differences (often exceeding 50%) were significant for the number of\nactive joints, patients' overall well-being, number of patients with episodes of \nclinical remission off medication (CROM) and duration of these episodes, patients\nin CROM and ACR Pedi 30 response at follow-up. Additional exploratory analyses\nperformed to detect potential confounders related to patient characteristics or\nfollow-up treatment showed that DMARD treatment compliance was positively\ncorrelated with an ACR Pedi 30 response (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval \n(CI) 1.1 to 13.4; p = 0.03). Adjusted for compliance, an SSZ patient was 4.2\ntimes as likely as a PLAC patient to be an ACR Pedi 30 responder at follow-up\n(95% CI 1.3 to 14.3; p = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: This follow-up study shows that effective suppression of disease\nactivity by SSZ treatment early in active disease in JIA patients has beneficial \neffects that persist for many years. Given these results, compliance with DMARD\ntreatment deserves serious attention.\n\nPMCID: PMC2111611\nPMID: 17491099  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Outcome measures for efficacy were Disease Activity Score \n(DAS28), clinical remission, and modified Sharp radiographic score and for\nsafety, adverse events, and DMARD withdrawal.\nRESULTS: At baseline, subjects had at least moderately active disease (mean +/-\nSD DAS28 was 5.3 +/- 1.1), impaired function as measured by the modified Health\nAssessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) (0.9 +/- 0.5), and 37% had bone erosions. By 3\nmonths, 29% were in remission; this increased to 54% at 3 years. The greatest\nfall in DAS28 and improvement in mHAQ scores occurred in the first 12 months.\nErosions were detected in 62% at 3 years. The mean dose of parenteral\nglucocorticoid was equivalent to 0.1 mg/d of prednisolone. After 3 years, 48%\nremained on triple therapy; fish oil was consumed by 75% of patients, and 21%\nused nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gastrointestinal intolerance was the\nmost frequent unwanted event (leading to DMARD withdrawal in 17 patients).\nSulfasalazine was most frequently withdrawn (30%).\nCONCLUSION: This implementation study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and\nefficacy of combination therapy with inexpensive DMARDs, fish oil, and minimal\nglucocorticoid use, in routine clinical practice using predefined rules for\ndosage adjustment.\n\nPMID: 17391739  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients who discontinued MTX because of\ninsufficient clinical response (disease activity score, DAS >2.4) or toxicity\nwere classified as "MTX failures." In group 1, these patients switched to\nsulfasalazine (SSA), then leflunomide and finally to MTX + infliximab (IFX). In\ngroup 2, "MTX failures" added SSA to MTX, then hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), then\nprednisone, and eventually switched to MTX + IFX. "MTX successes" were patients\nwho achieved a DAS </=2.4 after 2 years while still on MTX monotherapy. Total\nSharp/van der Heijde score (TSS) progression from 0-2 years was assessed in "MTX \nfailures" versus "MTX successes."\nRESULTS: After 2 years, 162/244 patients (66%) had discontinued MTX because of\ninsufficient response or toxicity. Of these, 78% also failed on SSA (adding or\nswitching), 87% subsequently failed on leflunomide (in group 1), and 64% on MTX +\nSSA + HCQ (in group 2). 34 of 48 patients (71%) in groups 1 and 2 were\nsuccessfully treated with MTX + IFX.

They were randomly divided into Western medicine\n(WM) treated group, 194 cases; and traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CM)\ntreated group, 203 cases. A complete physical examination and 18 common clinical \nmanifestations were prepared before the randomization and after the treatment.\nThe WM therapy included voltaren extended action tablet, methotrexate and\nsulfasalazine. The CM therapy included Glucosidorum Tripterygii Totorum Tablet\nand syndrome differentiation treatment. The American College of Rheumatology 20\n(ACR20) was taken as efficacy evaluation. All data were analyzed on SAS 8.2\nstatistical package. The relationships between each variable and efficacy were\nanalyzed, and the variables with P<0.2 were included for the data mining analysis\nwith neural network model. All data were classified into training set (75%) and\nverification set (25%) for further verification on the data-mining model.\nRESULTS: Eighteen variables in CM and 24 variables in WM were included in the\ndata-mining model. In CM, morning stiffness, swollen joint number, peripheral\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) level, tenderness joint number, tenderness, rheumatoid\nfactor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP) and joint pain were positively related to\nthe efficacy, and disease duration and more urination at night negatively related\nto the efficacy. In WM, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), weak waist, white\nfur in tongue, joint pain, joint stiffness and swollen joint were positively\nrelated to the efficacy, and yellow fur in tongue, red tongue, white blood\nnegatively related to the efficacy. In the analysis with the neural network model\nin the patients of verification set, the predictive response rates of 20%\npatients would be 100% and 90% in the treatment with CM and WM, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Neural network model analysis, based on the full clinical trial data \nwith collection of both traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine\ndiagnostic information, shows a good predictive role for the information in the\nefficacy in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPMID: 17214933  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

TNF a, b and \nc microsatellite and HLA-DRB1 typings were carried out in 165 (79 COMBI; 86\nSINGLE) study completers.\nRESULTS: At baseline the 28 joint disease activity scores (DAS28) of the patients\npositive for TNFa2, a13 or b1 microsatellite markers were significantly higher\nthan in the other patients. In the SINGLE patients the DAS28 improved comparably \nin patients with (n = 31) or without (n = 53) the TNFb1 marker (NS), while the\nDAS28 of the TNFb1-positive COMBI patients (n = 22) improved significantly more\nthan that of the TNFb1-negative cases (n = 57) (p = 0.014). Respective 31.8%\n(7/22) and 28.1% (16/57) of the COMBI patients with or without TNFb1 allele\nachieved remission at one year. The corresponding figure in SINGLE patients were \n0% (0/31) and 20.8% (11/53) (p = 0.006). At two years the remission frequencies\nin the TNFb1+/TNFb1- patients in the COMBI and SINGLE were 50.0%/38.6% and\n9.7%/22.6%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Early TNFb1+ RA patients have more active disease but respond more\nfavourably to COMBI treatment than the patients without this microsatellite\nallele.

However, direct comparison of this drug with \nstandard DMARDs including sulfasalazine (SASP) and methotrexate (MTX) has been\nscarcely reported. We therefore tried to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Buc by\nanalyzing the database from the long-term observational cohort study IORRA\n(previously known as J-ARAMIS). The cross-sectional analysis revealed that\nresponses to Buc treatment were better in males, patients with shorter duration\nof illness, and those who were rheumatoid factor-negative. In the longitudinal\nanalysis, although there was no marked difference among the baseline variables of\npatients with Buc, SASP, and MTX, the percentage of patients exhibiting moderate \nor good response to treatment, as rated using the European League Against\nRheumatism improvement criteria, was higher in the Buc group (41.0%) than in the \nMTX (32.6%) and SASP groups (25.6%).

Thirty-six patients with IRD including 20 \npatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 16 patients with ankylosing\nspondylitis (AS) (22 women, 14 men, mean ages 43.3 +/- 8.8 years), and 18 healthy\ncontrols (10 women, 8 men, mean ages 42.5 +/- 9.9 years) matched by age and body \nmass index were enrolled in this study. For the evaluation of enthesal\nstructures, all patients and controls underwent ultrasonographic (USG)\nexaminations of five enthesal sites of both lower limbs using high-resolution and\nDoppler USG. An ultrasonographic score of lower limb enthesitis was calculated\nusing Glasgow ultrasound enthesitis scoring system (GUESS). Clinical and\nlaboratory activities of IRD patients were also evaluated. Patient group was made\nto undergo 2 g/day sulfasalazine monotherapy for 1 year. All evaluations were\nmade at the beginning of the treatment and repeated after 1 year follow-up.\nResults showed that the frequency of enthesal abnormalities of the IRD group was \nsignificantly higher than controls. On USG examination, 301/1,296 (23.2%)\nenthesal structures were abnormal in IRD patients, and 19/648 (2.93%) structures \nwere abnormal in controls. Mean GUESS score of the IRD group (6.40 +/- 2.41) was \nalso significantly higher than controls (1.79 +/- 1.60) (p < 0.001). Although\nthere was a significant improvement in clinical and laboratory activity\nparameters of the IRD patients, significant decrease was not observed in enthesal\nabnormalities (295/1,296 enthesal structures-22.7%) and mean GUESS score (6.20\n+/- 2.38) after 1 year sulfasalazine trial. Additionally, there was no\nsignificant improvement in enthesal abnormalities and mean GUESS scores of AS and\nRA subgroups separately. Sulfasalazine treatment was not found effective on\nenthesal abnormalities of IRD patients. Further studies with larger groups\nincluding other IRDs are required to validate our results.\n\nPMID: 17086383  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

C.F.Allaart@lumc.nl\n\nAIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of four different treatment strategies\nfor patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMETHODS: In the BeSt study, 508 patients with newly diagnosed (< 2 years) active \nRA were randomised to be treated according to four treatment strategies: 1.\nsequential monotherapy, 2. step up to combination therapy (both starting with\nmethotrexate), 3. initial combination therapy with methotrexate, sulphasalazine, \nand a tapered high dose of prednisone, and 4. initial combination therapy with\nmethotrexate and infliximab. Three-monthly therapy adjustments were dictated by\ncalculation of the Disease Activity Score (DAS), with the goal to achieve and\nmaintain a DAS <or= 2.4. Functional ability was measured every 3 months with the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire. Radiographs of hands and feet were assessed\nyearly, blinded for patient identity and treatment, and in random order, to\nmeasure joint damage progression (Sharp/van der Heijde score).\nRESULTS: After 2 years of treatment, 80% of all patients achieved the goal of DAS\n<or= 2.4, and 42% reached clinical remission (DAS < 1.6). Initial combination\ntherapy, either with prednisone (group 3) or with infliximab (group 4), resulted \nin earlier improvement in functional ability, more continuous clinical remission \n(DAS < 1.6), and less joint damage progression than initial monotherapy (groups 1\nand 2). Patients in groups 1 and 2 needed more therapy adjustments, including\nintroduction of combination therapy with prednisone or infliximab, to achieve a\nDAS <or= 2.4, whereas many patients in groups 3 and 4 were able to taper their\nmedication to sulphasalazine or methotrexate, respectively, monotherapy. The\nadverse events profile was comparable in all groups. The presence or absence of\nrheumatoid factor, HLA DR4, or anti-CCP was not associated with radiologic damage\nprogression.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with early, active RA, remarkable clinical improvement\nand suppression of joint damage progression can be achieved with frequent,\nobjectively steered treatment adjustments. The best chance for an early clinical \nand radiologic response lies with initial combination therapy with either\nmethotrexate, sulphasalazine and prednisone or with methotrexate and infliximab, \nwhich can be tapered to DMARD monotherapy once low disease activity is achieved.\n\nPMID: 17083767  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Powstancow Wlkp.\n72, 70-111, Szczecin, Poland.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial disease, with\nimmunological, genetical as well as environmental factors being implicated in its\npathogenesis. Treatment of RA is based mainly on drugs modulating the course of\nthe disease, e.g. methotrexate (MTX) or sulfasalazine (SL). The MDR1 gene\nproduct, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is probably one of the most important and best\ndefined transporters for drug delivery in humans. P-gp transports a wide range of\nsubstrates with diverse chemical structures, among them anticancer agents,\ncardiac drugs, and immunosuppressants. The aim of this study was to examine the\neffect of the 3435C>T MDR1 gene polymorphism on the efficacy of RA treatment with\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, i.e. MTX plus methylprednisolone (MP), and\nSL.\nMETHODS: The study was carried out on 255 patients with RA treated according to\ntwo regimes: (1) MTX (7.5-15.0 mg weekly) plus low doses of MP (n=174), (2) SL\n(1.5-3 g daily, n=81).\nRESULTS: The probability of remission of RA symptoms after MTX plus MP therapy\nwas 4.65-fold higher in carriers of the TT genotype compared to patients with CC \ngenotype (P=0.003, OR 4.65, 95%CI 1.66-13.05), whereas the probability of\nremission of RA symptoms in patients treated with SL was 2-fold higher in\ncarriers of TT genotype compared to patients with CC genotype, but did not reach \nstatistical significance (P=0.358, OR=2.00 95% CI=0.58-6.87).\nCONCLUSION: The results from the present study suggest that the 3435C>T MDR1 gene\npolymorphism may influence the efficacy of RA therapy with disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drugs.\n\nPMID: 16932953  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2006 Aug 22.\n\nCombination therapy with sulfasalazine and methotrexate is more effective than\neither drug alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a suboptimal\nresponse to sulfasalazine: results from the double-blind placebo-controlled\nMASCOT study.\n\nCapell HA(1), Madhok R, Porter DR, Munro RA, McInnes IB, Hunter JA, Steven M,\nZoma A, Morrison E, Sambrook M, Wui Poon F, Hampson R, McDonald F, Tierney A,\nHenderson N, Ford I.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, 84 Castle Street, Glasgow\nG4 0SF, UK. hilary.capell@northglasgow.scot.nhs.uk\n\nBACKGROUND: Optimal use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in\nrheumatoid arthritis is vital if progression of disease is to be reduced.\nMethotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SASP) are widely used inexpensive DMARDs,\nrecently often combined despite no firm evidence of benefit from previous\nstudies. Aim: To establish whether a combination of SASP and MTX is superior to\neither drug alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a suboptimal\nresponse to 6 months of SASP.\nMETHODS: A randomised controlled study of step-up DMARD treatment in early\nrheumatoid arthritis. In phase I, 687 patients received SASP for 6 months. Those \nwith a disease activity score (DAS) > or =2.4 were offered additional treatment\nin phase II (SASP alone, MTX alone or a combination of the two). The primary\noutcome measure was change in DAS.\nRESULTS: At 6 months, 191 (28%) patients had a DAS <2.4, 123 (18%) were eligible \nbut did not wish to enter phase II, 130 (19%) stopped SASP because of reversible \nadverse events and 165 (24%) entered phase II. DAS at 18 months was significantly\nlower in those who received combination treatment compared with those who\nreceived either SASP or MTX: monotherapy arms did not differ. Improvement in\nEuropean League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology 20, 50\nand 70 scores favoured combination therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this "true-to-life" study, an inexpensive combination of DMARDs\nproved more effective than monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with\na suboptimal response to SASP. There was no increase in toxicity. These results\nprovide an evidence base for the use of this combination as a component of tight \ncontrol strategies.\n\nPMCID: PMC1798490\nPMID: 16926184  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fish oil has been shown to\nreduce symptoms in RA and to reduce CV risk. We assessed the effect of an\nantiinflammatory dose of fish oil on CV risk factors within a program of\ncombination chemotherapy for patients with early RA.\nMETHODS: Patients who chose not to take fish oil (n = 13) were compared with\npatients who achieved a sustained elevation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in\nplasma phospholipid fatty acids (> 5% total fatty acids) while taking fish oil\nover a 3-year period (n = 18). We examined cellular content of arachidonic acid\n(AA), synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin E2, use of nonsteroidal\nantiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), traditional CV lipid risk factors, and disease\nactivity at 3 years.\nRESULTS: At 3 years, AA (as a proportion of AA plus long-chain n-3 fatty acids\nthat can compete with AA for cyclooxygenase metabolism) was 30% lower in\nplatelets and 40% lower in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in subjects taking \nfish oil. Serum thromboxane B2 was 35% lower and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated\nwhole-blood prostaglandin E2 was 41% lower with fish oil ingestion compared to no\nfish oil. NSAID use was reduced by 75% from baseline with fish oil (p < 0.05) and\nby 37% without fish oil (NS). Favorable changes in fasting blood lipids were seen\nwith, but not without fish oil. Remission at 3 years was more frequent with fish \noil use (72%) compared to no fish oil (31%).\nCONCLUSION: Fish oil reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with RA through\nmultiple mechanisms.\n\nPMID: 16881100  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Results\nwere evaluated on the basis of the duration of treatment for each drug with\ninefficacy or inadequate efficacy as one endpoint for discontinuation and adverse\ndrug reactions (ADRs) as the other in single agent and combination therapy. The\nincidence and nature of ADRs in single and combination treatment are described.\nRESULTS: The effects of MTX, SSZ and BUC on clinical parameters were monitored\nover the first three months, and in particular, NPJs and NSJs were found to\ndecrease significantly during single agent MTX or BUC treatment over 108 months. \nCRP levels remained significantly improved for more than 120 months with MTX. In \nthe single and combination long-term treatments, continuation rate with\ninefficacy or inadequate efficacy as the end point achieved for each of the\ntreatments were 83.1% for MTX, 76.0% for BUC, 68.5% for SSZ, and in the case of\nthe combination treatments, these rates were 83.3% for MTX + BUC and 71.0% for\nMTX+SSZ. Continuation rates using ADRs as the end point were 88% for SSZ, 79.6%\nfor BUC and 79.4% for MTX. The incidences of ADRs for the various treatments\nwere: MTX 22.2%, SSZ 11.0%, BUC 20.6%, MTX + BUC 30.0% and MTX + SSZ 31.2%.\nCONCLUSION: MTX showed the highest efficacy even though it was administrated at a\nlow dose (6-8 mg), as a single agent or in combination with other treatment.\nHowever, in combination treatments, the continuous duration of treatment ending\nin ADRs as the end point were lower than those in single treatments with MTX, SSZ\nand BUC.\n\nPMID: 16870092  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nprimary end point was a 20% response by the American College of Rheumatology\n(ACR) criteria at 24 weeks.\nRESULTS: At baseline, the three treatment groups (sulfasalazine, n = 50;\netanercept, n = 103; etanercept and sulfasalazine, n = 101) were comparable for\ndemographic variables and disease activity. Lack of efficacy was the primary\nreason for discontinuation (sulfasalazine, n = 12; etanercept, n = 1; etanercept \nand sulfasalazine, n = 4; p<0.001). Significantly more patients receiving\netanercept, alone or in combination (74% for each), achieved ACR 20 responses at \n24 weeks than those receiving sulfasalazine (28%; p<0.01). Similarly, more\npatients in the etanercept groups achieved ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses than those\nin the sulfasalazine group (p<0.01). In the groups receiving etanercept,\nsignificant differences in the ACR core components were observed by week 2\ncompared with those receiving sulfasalazine alone (p<0.01). The incidences of\nseveral common adverse events (headache, nausea, asthenia) were lower with\netanercept alone than with the combination (p<0.05), but infections and injection\nsite reactions were higher with etanercept alone (p<0.05). The safety profiles of\nboth etanercept treatment groups were comparable with previous experience of\netanercept.\nCONCLUSIONS: For all efficacy variables assessed, etanercept alone or in\ncombination with sulfasalazine resulted in substantial and similar improvement in\ndisease activity from baseline to week 24 compared with sulfasalazine alone in\npatients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite their sulfasalazine treatment. \nAll three treatments were generally well tolerated.\n\nPMCID: PMC1798315\nPMID: 16606651  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The scheme of WM therapy included administration of voltaren extended\naction tablet, methotrexate and sulfasalazine. That of CM therapy included basic \ntreatment and medication by syndrome differentiation. Eighteen items of often\nseen symptoms of the patients were collected before and after treatment. The\ntherapeutic effect was evaluated by the American College of Rheumatology 20%\nimprovement (ACR 20) and all data were analyzed using SAS 8.2 statistical\nsoftware package. The category of symptoms was analyzed by factor analysis. The\ncorrelation of changes of various common factors with the therapeutic efficacy\nwere analyzed by one-way ANOVA test.\nRESULTS: Four common factors were obtained from the 18 items of symptoms, which\ncould better reflect respectively the local status of arthritis, and symptoms of \nCold-syndrome, Asthenia-syndrome and Heat-syndrome in traditional Chinese\nmedicine (TCM). Both CM and WM therapies showed consistent effect on the common\nfactors that reflects the state of RA, but CM therapy showed superior effect on\nthe common factors to improve Asthenia-syndrome to that of WM therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Factor analysis could be used to categorize and study the important\nfactor symptoms in the syndrome differentiation of TCM, and the results of factor\nanalysis were in accord with the category of TCM syndrome differentiation.

Data\nwere obtained from 418 sets of radiographs of the clinically involved and\ncontralateral joints (at study entry and at 6 months' followup) from 66 JIA\npatients. The Dijkstra score assesses the presence or absence of swelling,\nosteopenia, joint space narrowing, growth abnormalities, subchondral bone cysts, \nerosions, and malalignment. These signs were combined in the Dijkstra composite\nscore, to assess inflammation (DI), growth (DG), and damage (DD). Progression was\ndefined as an increase in either the DG or the DD score. Scores were evaluated\namong all radiographs, a standard set of films (hand, foot, and knee), and per\npatient. All scores were used to explore differences between the 2 treatment\ngroups.\nRESULTS: Over time, 58% of joints remained normal, 23% remained abnormal but\nstable, 14% showed an increase in signs, and 5% showed a decrease in signs. Of\nthe 66 JIA patients, 12% had normal radiographic findings throughout followup,\n27% showed abnormalities at some sites without change, and 61% showed change in\nat least 1 site. Changes in the DI, DG, and DD scores varied considerably per\ntype of joint and occurred most frequently in joints of the standard set. DI and \nDG scores changed most often in the knees, while DD scores changed primarily in\nthe hands and feet. The disease course in 8% of joints was classified as\nprogressive. Films of SSZ-treated patients, versus the placebo group, showed less\ndeterioration by the DD scores (P = 0.04), and the disease course was more often \nclassified as nonprogressive in the SSZ group (P = 0.037). When progressors were \ndefined as those who had at least one radiograph showing progression,\nsignificantly more placebo-treated patients were considered progressors (P =\n0.046).\nCONCLUSION: In this trial data set, the Dijkstra composite score and the\nresulting progressor classification system are comprehensive and feasible tools\nthat are sensitive to change and discriminate between clinical situations. They\nshould now be tested by other investigators and in other data sets.\n\nPMID: 16142707  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The most commonly prescribed DMARD over the study period\nwas sulphasalazine (46.3%) and then methotrexate (31.4%). Use of methotrexate has\nincreased 17-fold (1.8% of all DMARD prescriptions in 1988 to 30% in 2002)\nwhereas use of gold has fallen (13.2% to 2.3%). Analysis of DMARD persistence\nusing Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed the methotrexate use persisted\nsignificantly longer than other DMARDs with an estimated median of 8.1 yr.\nPrednisolone was used in up to 50% of RA patients in any one year and has\nremained fairly constant throughout the study period.\nCONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of RA\nidentified from a large primary care database are not receiving DMARDs. This work\nsuggests that many individuals with RA have not been treated appropriately and\nthis may have major long-term consequences on joint damage and general health.\n\nPMID: 16030083  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Rheumatology outpatient centres were\nrandomised to systematic monitoring of disease activity using the DAS28 (12\ncentres, 205 patients) or usual care (12 centres, 179 patients). The aim for the \nDAS group was to reach a DAS28 score of < or =3.2 by changes in DMARD treatment, \nat the discretion of the rheumatologist and the patient.\nRESULTS: At baseline, disease activity was the same in both groups, with an\noverall mean (SD) DAS28 of 4.5 (1.2); 13% of the patients had a DAS28 of < or\n=3.2. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients in the DAS group had a DAS28 < or =3.2, while \nin the usual care centres this was 16% (p = 0.028). DMARDs were changed on\naverage in 18% of visits in the DAS centres; in the 12 usual care centres they\nwere changed on 8% of the visits (p = 0.013). The doses of methotrexate,\nsulfasalazine, and corticosteroids appeared to be higher in the DAS centres than \nin the usual care centres, but the differences were not significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: In daily practice, systematic monitoring of disease activity in\nrheumatoid arthritis may lead to more changes in DMARD treatment, resulting in a \nlarger number of patients with low disease activity.\n\nPMCID: PMC1755664\nPMID: 15829574  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Treatment responses were\nevaluated according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. After\na 5-year followup, the cumulative number of days of sick leave and RA-related\npermanent work disability was calculated for each of the 162 patients who were\navailable for the active work force at baseline.\nRESULTS: Of the 159 patients assessed at 6 months, 29 were in clinical remission,\n66 achieved an ACR50 response but not remission, 29 achieved an ACR20 response\nbut not an ACR50 response, and 35 failed to achieve an ACR20 response. In these 4\ngroups, the median numbers of work disability days per patient-year from 6 months\nthrough 60 months of followup were 0 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-3), 4 (IQR\n0-131), 16 (IQR 0-170), and 352 (16-365), respectively (P < 0.001). Pairwise\nmultiple comparisons showed a statistically significant difference between all\ngroups except the ACR50 and ACR20 groups. At 12 months, 30 patients were in\nremission. None of the 44 patients in remission at 6 or 12 months became\npermanently work disabled over the 5-year followup, as compared with 15 patients \nin the ACR50 group (23%), 6 in the ACR20 group (21%), and 19 without an ACR20\nresponse at 6 months (56%).\nCONCLUSION: Prompt induction of remission translates into maintenance of work\ncapacity. At 6 months, an ACR50 response is no better than an ACR20 response with\nregard to future productivity, while failure to achieve an ACR20 response carries\na high risk for work disability.\n\nPMID: 15641055  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Analyses of the\nefficacy and direct costs of the treatments have already been reported.\nMETHODS: Patients with early RA selected for the 56-week trial were randomly\nassigned to prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (the COBRA combination)\n(n = 76, tapered after 28 weeks) or to sulfasalazine (SSZ; n = 79, of which 78\npatients were evaluable) alone. The main efficacy outcomes were a pooled index\nand radiographic damage score in hands and feet, and utilities. Direct and\nindirect costs were measured (from a societal perspective) by means of cost\ndiaries and interviews completed by patients during the intervention phase and\nthe followup phase, each lasting 28 weeks. Differences in mean costs between\ngroups and cost-utility ratios were evaluated by applying nonparametric\nbootstrapping techniques.\nRESULTS: In the first 28 weeks, indirect costs per patient totaled US $2,578 and \nUS $3,638 for COBRA and SSZ therapy, respectively (p = 0.09). The total costs\nwere $5,931 and $7,853, respectively (p < 0.05). These differences were lost in\nthe second 28 weeks. For the total period the mean total costs per patient were\n$10,262 and $12,788, respectively (p = 0.11). Sensitivity analyses showed\nrobustness of the data. The point estimate of the cost per quality-adjusted\nlife-year based on the rating scale was negative at $-385, suggesting dominance\nof COBRA (more effect at lower cost).\nCONCLUSION: COBRA therapy adds additional disease control (improvements in\ndisease activity, physical function, and rate of damage progression) at lower or \nequal cost compared to SSZ in early RA.\n\nPMID: 15338488  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hilary.Capell@northglasgow.scot.nhs.uk\n\nComment in\n    Ann Rheum Dis. 2004 Nov;63(11):1533-4; author reply 1534.\n\nBACKGROUND: Evidence for disease modifying activity of low dose corticosteroid\ntreatment in rheumatoid arthritis is contradictory. Studies showing radiological \nbenefit suggest that continued treatment is required to sustain the effect.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low dose oral prednisolone in early\nrheumatoid arthritis on disease activity over two years.\nDESIGN: Double blind placebo controlled trial.\nMETHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, duration <3 years (n = 167), were\nstarted on a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; sulphasalazine) and\nallocated by stratified randomisation to prednisolone 7 mg/day or placebo.\nPrimary outcome measure was radiological damage, assessed by the modified Sharp\nmethod. Clinical benefit was a secondary outcome. A proactive approach to\nidentifying and treating corticosteroid adverse events was adopted. Patients who \ndiscontinued sulphasalazine were offered an alternative DMARD.\nRESULTS: 90 of 257 patients eligible for the study refused to participate (more\nwomen than men). Of those enrolled, 84% were seropositive for rheumatoid factor, \nmedian age 56 years, median disease duration 12 months, female to male ratio\n1.8:1. Prednisolone was given to 84 patients; of these 73% continued prednisolone\nand 70% sulphasalazine at 2 years. Of the 83 patients on placebo, 80% continued\nplacebo and 64% sulphasalazine at 2 years. There were no significant differences \nin radiological score or clinical and laboratory measures at 0 and 2 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low dose prednisolone conferred no radiological or clinical benefit \non patients maintained on a DMARD over two years.

Rlan@sint.azm.nl\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate in a randomized clinical trial setting with an\naggressive combination-therapy arm and a mild-monotherapy arm, whether\ntherapy-induced changes in urinary C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I \ncollagen (CTX-I) and type II collagen (CTX-II) predict 5-year radiographic\nprogression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMETHODS: Patients had participated in the COBRA (Combinatietherapie Bij\nReumato\xc3\xafde Artritis) trial comparing aggressive step-down combination therapy\n(the COBRA regimen, including temporary high-dose prednisolone, temporary\nlow-dose methotrexate, and sulfasalazine [SSZ]) and mild monotherapy (SSZ).\nUrinary CTX-I and CTX-II levels were measured at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12\nmonths after initiation of treatment. Radiographs were scored according to the\nmodified Sharp/van der Heijde method (mean of 2 independent readers who were\naware of the sequence). Individual long-term radiographic progression was\nestimated, using baseline radiographs and all radiographs obtained during the\nfollowup period, by simple linear regression analysis (curve fitting).\nRESULTS: Both COBRA therapy and SSZ monotherapy produced a significant decrease\nin urinary CTX-I and CTX-II levels at 3 months, and this decrease was amplified\nat 6 months. COBRA therapy suppressed CTX-II (change from baseline levels -36%\nand -43% at 3 and 6 months, respectively), but not CTX-I, significantly better\nthan did SSZ (-17% and -21% at 3 and 6 months, respectively) at 3 and 6 months.\nThe magnitude of the decrease in urinary CTX-II levels at 3 months significantly \npredicted long-term (5-year) radiographic progression (beta = 0.48 [95%\nconfidence interval (95% CI) 0.13, 0.83]). This effect was independent of the\nchange in disease activity and inflammation indices at 3 months. Patients whose\nCTX-II levels were normalized (<150 ng/mmoles of urinary creatinine) at 3 months \nhad a significantly higher chance of radiographic stability (no progression over \n5 years) than did patients whose CTX-II levels were increased both at baseline\nand at 3 months (odds ratio 4.5 [95% CI 1.5, 13]).\nCONCLUSION: The individual CTX-II response measured after 3 months of therapy in \npatients with active RA who had increased CTX-II levels at baseline independently\npredicts long-term radiographic progression. Urinary CTX-II levels may be used as\nearly markers of treatment efficacy in patients with RA.\n\nPMID: 15146408  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The wild-type allele (NAT2*4) and\nthree variant alleles (NAT2*5B, *6A, and *7B) of NAT2 were determined by the\npolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Plasma\nconcentrations of SASP and its two metabolites, sulfapyridine (SP) and\nN-acetylsulfapyridine (AcSP), were estimated by HPLC. Therapeutic efficacy and\nincidence of adverse reactions were also monitored as recommended by the American\nCollege of Rheumatology.\nRESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups by NAT2 genotyping: Rapid\nType (homozygote for NAT2*4), Intermediate Type (heterozygote for NAT2*4 and\nvariant alleles), and Slow Type (homozygote for variant alleles). There was no\nclear difference in the genotype frequencies between RA patients and healthy\nsubjects. NAT2 genotypes significantly affected both the plasma concentration\nratios of SP to AcSP (SP/AcSP) and the efficacy of SASP (p < 0.05). Adverse\nreactions to SASP were found in 26 (27.1%) out of 96 patients, and there was no\ndifference among the three genotype groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: NAT2 gene polymorphism is related to the plasma SP/AcSP ratio and\nthe efficacy of SASP.\n\nPMID: 15032315  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nprogression from 1 to 4 years did not differ significantly between the groups. At\n4 years, joint destruction in both groups was positively correlated with the\npresence of the shared epitope.\nCONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of early DMARD treatment on the radiological\nprogression of joint damage is still present at 4 years. However, the rate of\njoint destruction from 1 to 4 years did not differ between the delayed and early \ntreatment group. Neither the radiographic nor the immunogenetic data suggest that\nlonglasting disease modification has been induced by early treatment.\n\nPMCID: PMC1754928\nPMID: 14962962  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

At baseline,\n162 patients (80 in the combination-treatment group and 82 in the\nsingle-treatment group) were still working or at least available for work. After \n5 years of followup, data on all sick leave and retirement were obtained from\nsocial insurance registers or case records. The main outcome for each patient was\nthe cumulative duration of all sick leaves and RA-related disability pensions,\ndivided by the observation period during which the patient was not retired\nbecause of another disease or because of age.\nRESULTS: The cumulative duration of work disability per patient-observation year \nwas significantly lower in those randomized to combination therapy than in those \nrandomized to single therapy: median 12.4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 0-54)\nversus 32.2 days (IQR 6-293) (P = 0.008, sex- and age-adjusted P = 0.009). This\nwas mainly due to the difference in sick leaves (i.e., work disability periods\n</=300 days): median 11.7 days (IQR 0-44) per patient-observation year in those\ntreated with combination therapy and 30.0 days (IQR 6-68) in those treated with\nsingle therapy (P = 0.002).

There was also no\nsignificant change in the biochemical parameters of both groups.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that low-dose methotrexate has no negative\neffect on BMD in premenopausal RA patients.\n\nPMID: 14504915  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

LEF treatment groups were matched for patients\'\nage, baseline ESR, number of previous DMARDs, and hospital cohort with MTX and\nSSZ treatment groups. For these treatments, Kaplan-Meier analyses of time until\nthe drug was discontinued (drug "survival"), and the effectiveness and safety of \ncontinuation of treatment, were performed. The change in disease activity markers\n(CRP, ESR) was compared between the groups.\nRESULTS: The median dose during the study increased from 10 to 15 mg MTX/week and\nfrom 1.5 to 2.0 g SSZ/day. Matched survival analysis showed better retention\nrates for MTX (mean (SEM) survival 28 (1) months) than for LEF (20 (1) months;\np=0.001), whereas retention rates of SSZ (23 (1) months) were similar to those of\nLEF (p=NS). Treatments were stopped earlier because of adverse events (AEs, 3\nmonths) than because of ineffectiveness (IE, 10 months; p<0.001). LEF and MTX\nwere less likely to be stopped because of AEs than SSZ. LEF courses were stopped \nearlier for AEs (p<0.001) than MTX.\nCONCLUSIONS: Current dosing strategies should be re-evaluated, and coping\nstrategies for common AEs should be investigated. This will be necessary to\nachieve better drug retention of LEF. At present, MTX continues to be the most\neffective drug in clinical practice.\n\nPMCID: PMC1754333\nPMID: 12972472  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Criteria for inclusion: patients with early RA (< or =1\nyear duration). Follow up: between the end of years 1 and 5, patients were\nfollowed up and treated by their own rheumatologist, who was allowed to indicate \nany treatment. Outcome measures: disease activity score (DAS), health assessment \nquestionnaire (HAQ), and Sharp/van der Heijde radiological score at baseline and \nafter five years of follow up. Analysis: comparison of the five year follow up\nDAS, HAQ, and radiological scores in patients given combined and single treatment\nduring the first year.\nRESULTS: At the end of the five years of follow up, the patients primarily\nreceiving single or combined treatment had similar mean DAS, HAQ, and\nradiographic scores.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with early RA using combined therapy with MTX\nand SSZ during the first year did not influence the long term inflammatory\nstatus, or disability, or structural changes, compared with single disease\nmodifying antirheumatic drug treatment.\n\nPMCID: PMC1754629\nPMID: 12860733  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Function was assessed by the HAQ and radiographic\nprogression by Larsen scores. A patient who managed to remain on the allocated\ntreatment for two years was described as a "completer".\nRESULTS: After 2 years of treatment, 70% of the patients in T1 and 63% in T2 were\nresponders (30% and 33% "good responders", respectively). In T1 29% and in T2 19%\nwere in remission. There was a significant functional improvement in both groups \nbut radiographic progression occurred. The mean decrease in HAQ and increase in\nthe Larsen score were similar in the two groups. One-third of the patients were\nnon-completers, 19% from T1 and 47% from T2. Non-completers had, compared with\ncompleters, a significantly lower rate of individual response and remission.\nCompleters and non-completers had similar functional improvement and similar\nradiological progression.\nCONCLUSIONS: Individual response and remission was reduced in patients who did\nnot complete their first DMARD/CS treatment option. Treatment failures were\nsignificantly more frequent in the sulfasalazine plus optional CS than in the CS \nplus optional methotrexate treatment group.\n\nPMID: 12846051  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A three month control period was followed by a 12\nmonth period, where feedback on disease activity, disability, and damage was\nprovided to the rheumatologist. The primary outcome measure was the rheumatoid\narthritis disease activity index (RADAI).\nRESULTS: The feedback system was used for 142/228 (62%) patients. Disease\nmodifying antirheumatic drug changes occurred in 69/169 (41%) patients. In\npatients with high disease activity and feedback use (n=70), the RADAI decreased \nin the feedback period by -0.27 points per 30 days (p<0.05), as compared with the\ncontrol period. Patients for whom the feedback system was used had a better\noutcome than non-users.\nCONCLUSION: Much more training on the use of a feedback system and outcome\nmeasures, as well as the inclusion of explicit treatment guidelines will be\nnecessary to increase the clinical use of measurement feedback and, possibly, to \nreduce disease activity for a larger number of patients with RA.\n\nPMCID: PMC1754606\nPMID: 12810423  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The mean age was 9.1 years\n(range 2.5-17.6 years), and the median disease duration was 24 months (range\n5-176 months). Thirteen percent of the patients were IgM rheumatoid factor\n(IgM-RF) positive, and 16% were HLA-B27 positive. All 68 clinically evaluated\njoints were included in the maximum of 19 radiographed joints (or joint groups)\nper patient. The mean number of radiographed joints per patient was 7 (range\n2-15); knees, hands, ankles, and feet were most frequently affected. Fifty-eight \npatients (87%) had radiologic abnormalities in at least one joint (soft-tissue\nswelling in 63% of patients, growth disturbances in 48%, joint space narrowing in\n28%, and erosions in 15%). In total, half of the radiographs of the clinically\ninvolved joints showed radiologic abnormalities, including two-thirds of the\nradiographs of the clinically affected hands and knees. Univariate analysis\nrevealed a good correlation between the overall articular (clinical) severity and\nthe presence of radiologic abnormalities (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, P < 0.0001).\nMultivariate analysis showed increased ORs for the presence of radiologic\nabnormalities and IgM-RF positivity (OR 4.6, P = 0.005) or HLA-B27 positivity (OR\n3.0, P = 0.004). In general, reproducibility of the radiologic scoring method was\ngood (mean kappa coefficient of 0.74 [range 0.40-0.86]), although there were\nscoring discrepancies for swelling, osteopenia, and growth disturbances. The\nscoring took 10-20 minutes per patient.\nCONCLUSION: Our model of describing and scoring radiologic abnormalities of\nradiographed joints in JIA was feasible, mostly reproducible, correlated well\nwith the overall articular severity score, and added substantial new information \nnot available on clinical examination.\n\nPMID: 12571861  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We sought to determine whether\nurinary C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I (CTX-I) and type II\n(CTX-II) collagen (markers of bone and cartilage destruction, respectively) are\nassociated with long-term radiologic progression in patients with early RA.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective study of 110 patients with early RA who were\nparticipating in the COBRA (Combinatietherapie Bij Reumato\xc3\xafde Artritis) clinical \ntrial and followup study, a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of\noral pulse prednisolone, methotrexate, plus sulfasalazine with sulfasalazine\nalone. We investigated the relationship between baseline levels of urinary CTX-I \nand CTX-II and the mean annual progression of joint destruction over a median of \n4 years, as measured by changes in the modified Sharp score (average of 2\nindependent readers).\nRESULTS: In multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline urinary CTX-I and\nCTX-II levels in the highest tertile were the strongest predictors of radiologic \nprogression (Sharp score increase >2 units/year; odds ratio 7.9 and 11.2,\nrespectively), independently of treatment group, erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR), Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, rheumatoid factor (RF), and baseline \njoint damage (Sharp score). The likelihood ratios for a positive test were 3.8\nand 8.0 for CTX-I and CTX-II, respectively, which compared favorably with the\nlikelihood ratios for the ESR (3.0), baseline joint damage (1.6), and RF (1.8).\nWhen patients were grouped according to the presence (Sharp score >/=4, n = 49)\nand absence (Sharp score <4, n = 61) of joint damage at baseline, CTX-I and\nCTX-II levels were predictive only in those without baseline joint damage (odds\nratio 14.9 and 25.7, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: High baseline levels of urinary CTX-I and CTX-II independently\npredict an increased risk of radiologic progression over 4 years in patients with\nearly RA, especially those without radiologic joint damage. Urinary CTX-I and\nCTX-II may be useful for identifying individual RA patients at high risk of\nprogression very early in the disease, before erosions can be detected\nradiographically. Such patients may be in special need of treatments that inhibit\nbone and cartilage degradation.\n\nPMID: 12428224  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Lessons from the leflunomide clinical trials database.\n\nScott DL(1), Strand V.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, GKT School of Medicine, Dulwich Hospital, East\nDulwich Grove, London, SE22 9PT, UK.\n\nOBJECTIVE: A primary therapeutic goal in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is to reduce\nfunctional disability. The recent introduction of several new drugs for RA\ncreates a need for readily assessing the effectiveness of therapy. Because the\nconsistent use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) reduces\nlong-term disability, we analysed the large database of 1817 RA patients from\nleflunomide trials to assess if changes in the Health Assessment Questionnaire\n(HAQ) can measure the effectiveness of RA therapy.\nMETHODS: Data from three randomized double-blind RA trials were evaluated. The\npatients had received 100 mg leflunomide (then 20 mg/day in 807 cases),\nmethotrexate (15-20 mg/day in 669 cases), sulphasalazine (2 g/day in 132 cases)\nand placebo (in 209 cases). HAQ scores and outcomes were assessed using the\nAmerican College of Rheumatology core data set. Detailed statistical analyses\nwere made of changes in outcome variables at 1 and 6 months, changes in HAQ\nscores at 1-12 months, and effect sizes for outcome variables at 6 and 12 months.\nMultiple regression models of changes in HAQ scores were evaluated using\nbackwards stepwise linear regression.\nRESULTS: Mean HAQ scores declined progressively with treatment with all three\nDMARDs. Changes occurred rapidly, and at month 1 were most pronounced with\nleflunomide. HAQ scores correlated closely with clinical response, as seen in\nchanges in non-responders and ACR 20% and 50% responders. Regression analysis\nindicated that pain intensity and global assessments were significant\ndeterminants of HAQ.\nCONCLUSION: HAQ scores are sensitive measures of effective DMARD therapy. HAQ may\nbe especially useful early in the treatment process to assess patients' responses\nto DMARDs that show rapid onset of action, such as leflunomide.\n\nPMID: 12154207  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The primary end-point was\n50% improvement according to the ACR criteria (ACR50) at 6, 12 or 18 months. The \nsecondary end-points were a full response (Magnusson criteria) and/or remission\n(ACR criteria) at 3 yr. Methotrexate (MTX) (group 1), cyclosporin A (CsA) (group \n2) or SSZ (group 3) was used first. After 6 months, a combination of two drugs\n(CsA and MTX) was employed in groups 1 and 2. SSZ was added after 12 months if\nimprovement was less than ACR50 with the combination. Group 3 continued with SSZ \nalone.\nRESULTS: After 6 months, 57% of patients in group 1, 31% of group 2 (MTX vs CsA, \nP=0.002) and 33% of group 3 (MTX vs SSZ, P=0.01) had reached ACR50 improvement\naccording to intention-to-treat analysis. At month 12 after starting a drug\ncombination, 67% of group 1 and 76% of group 2 had reached ACR50 compared with\n24% of group 3. At the 18-month follow-up, 90% of group 1 and 88% of group 2 but \nonly 24% of group 3 had reached ACR50. After 18 months, 62% of group 1, 60% of\ngroup 2 and 48% of group 3 showed side-effects and three, five and eight patients\nin the three groups respectively had dropped out of the study. At the 3-yr\nfollow-up, 9% of the patients in groups 1 and 2 and 7% of group 3 were in\nremission according to the ACR criteria; according to the Magnusson criteria, 40%\nshowed a full response in groups 1 and 2 but only 21% did so in group 3.\nCONCLUSION: MTX appears to be the fastest-acting agent. A step-up approach with\nMTX plus CsA plus SSZ led to a 50% improvement according to the ACR criteria in\nmost patients. After 3 yr, 40% of patients receiving combination therapy and 21% \nof patients receiving monotherapy showed a full response, while 9 and 7%\nrespectively attained remission.\n\nPMID: 12154206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The dosage of MTX was\naccelerated from 7.5 mg/week to 17.5 mg/week in all patients who were not in\nremission. Similarly, the dosage of SSZ was escalated from 500 mg twice a day to \n1 gm twice a day in patients who were not in remission. The primary end point of \nthe study was the percentage of patients who had a 20% response to therapy\naccording to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria at 2 years.\nRESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis revealed that patients receiving the triple\ncombination responded best, with 78% achieving an ACR 20% response at 2 years,\ncompared with 60% of those treated with MTX and HCQ (P = 0.05) and 49% of those\ntreated with MTX and SSZ (P = 0.002). Similar trends were seen for the ACR 50%\nresponse, with 55%, 40%, and 29% of patients in the 3 treatment groups,\nrespectively, achieving these results at 2 years (P = 0.005 for the triple\ncombination group versus the MTX and SSZ group). All combination treatments were \nwell-tolerated. Fourteen patients (evenly distributed among the 3 groups)\nwithdrew from the protocol because of symptoms that were potentially related to\nthe study medication.\nCONCLUSION: The triple combination of MTX, SSZ, and HCQ is well-tolerated, and\nits efficacy is superior to that of the double combination of MTX and SSZ and is \nmarginally superior to that of the double combination of MTX and HCQ.\n\nPMID: 12115219  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Despite the logic of early DMARD therapy,\nthere is a dearth of supportive evidence for this approach. We report a\nrandomised controlled trial comparing sulphasalazine monotherapy with diclofenac \nmonotherapy in early RA. The primary aim was to provide unequivocal evidence that\nearly DMARDs prevent erosive damage. The secondary aim was to evaluate if\nsulphasalazine used alone has comparable symptomatic benefits to NSAIDs.\nMETHODS: 117 patients with RA for under 12 months of diagnosis (mean 2 months)\nwere randomised (62 sulphasalazine; 55 diclofenac). Sulphasalazine patients\ncomprised 76% women, and 58% were rheumatoidfactor positive. Diclofenac patients \ncomprised 74% women, and 54% were seropositive. 36% completed 12 months of\ntherapy (16 sulphasalazine; 26 diclofenac); sulphasalazine was given for a mean\nperiod of 21 weeks and diclofenac for a mean period of 33 weeks. Results were\nanalysed on an intention to treat basis.\nRESULTS: After 12 months the mean number of new erosions in patients randomised\nto receive sulphasalazine was 2.0 (95%CI 0.9, 3.1) and in patients randomised to \nreceive diclofenac was 7.5 (95%CI 4.1, 10.9; p = 0.002 by Student\'s unpaired\nt-test). An analysis of valid compliant completers showed the mean number of new \nerosions in patients who received 12 months therapy with sulphasalazine was 2.3\n(95%CI 0.6, 4.0) and in patients who received 12 months diclofenac was 10.5\n(95%CI 5.0, 15.9; p = 0.018 by Student\'s unpaired t-test). The Ritchie articular \nindex, swollen joint counts and pain scores decreased with both sulphasalazine\nand diclofenac, with mean falls in both groups of 15-20% at 2 weeks and 30-40% at\n4 and 8 weeks. There were no differences between treatments. Disease activity\nscores showed similar highly significant mean decreases within both treatment\ngroups (P < 0.001 in all cases) of 0.5 at 2 weeks and 1.0 at 4 weeks; at 12 and\n26 weeks they were significantly lower with sulphasalazine (p = 0.036 and 0.045).\n75% of the patients given sulphasalazine and 65% of those given diclofenac had\none or more adverse events with no major differences between treatments.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show that an accelerated dosing schedule of\nsulphasalazine has identical effects to diclofenac in reducing symptoms,\nindicating it is a rapidly effective DMARD. They also provide unequivocal\nevidence, analysed on an intention to treat basis, that early treatment with\nsulphasalazine significantly reduces the extent of radiological progression in\nactive RA.\n\nPMID: 12102471  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In vivo effects on\nbone mineral density.\n\nMinaur NJ(1), Kounali D, Vedi S, Compston JE, Beresford JN, Bhalla AK.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)The Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Upper Borough Walls, Bath BA1\n1RL, UK.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of methotrexate (MTX) on bone mineral density \n(BMD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMETHODS: One hundred and sixteen non-steroid-treated RA subjects (90 women) were \nstudied in a prospective, longitudinal, non-randomized study. Subjects started\nMTX (n=36) or sulphasalazine (n=23) or continued long-term (>5 yr) treatment with\nMTX (n=28) or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (n=29). BMD was\nestimated at entry and after 1 yr. Markers of bone turnover were measured at\nentry and at 1 yr, and additionally at 3 and 6 months in those starting\ntreatment. Bone biopsies were taken before and after MTX treatment in four\nsubjects. The primary outcome was change in BMD Z score and secondary outcomes\nwere changes in bone turnover markers and bone formation by histomorphometry.\nRESULTS: Univariate analysis of covariance found that MTX at baseline was\nassociated with reduced BMD at the femoral neck. However, femoral neck BMD was\nalso associated with radiological damage score for the hand. Multivariate\nanalysis and discriminant analysis of the subset of post-menopausal women showed \nthat reduced bone density associated with MTX was due to confounders such as\ndisease activity. There was no adverse effect of MTX on bone turnover markers or \non measures of bone formation in biopsies.\nCONCLUSIONS: No adverse effect of low-dose MTX (mean 10 mg/week) on bone\nformation in RA was found.\n\nPMID: 12096222  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Serum MMP-3 levels, C-reactive\nprotein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), swollen joint count (SJC),\ntender joint count (TJC), Ritchie articular index (RAI), and the Disease Activity\nScore (DAS) were determined at 4 week intervals during a followup of 28 weeks for\neach treatment group. Response was based on clinical grounds and CRP at 12, 20,\nand 28 weeks.\nRESULTS: SSZ responders (n = 52) had lower baseline values of serum MMP-3, CRP,\nand ESR, compared to partial/nonresponders (n = 30), but did not differ in joint \nscores and DAS. In the SSZ responder group all variables decreased. In the SSZ\npartial/nonresponders, CRP, ESR, and SJC decreased in contrast to serum MMP-3,\nTJC. RAI, and DAS-3. After addition of MTX all variables decreased in 24 of the\n30 patients who had shown a partial or no response taking SSZ. In the SSZ\nresponders there was a delayed decrease in serum MMP-3 compared to CRP.\nCONCLUSION: Serum MMP-3 levels decrease in patients with early RA who respond to \nSSZ or to the combination of MTX and SSZ. In patients who respond to SSZ the\nchanges in serum MMP-3 levels indicate a delayed response compared to CRP.\n\nPMID: 12022344  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The presence of a shared epitope was tested for in 165 of\nthe 178 patients completing the study. The additional variables of age, sex,\npresence of rheumatoid factor, number of fulfilled American College of\nRheumatology criteria for the classification of RA, and length of delay from\nonset of symptoms to institution of therapy were entered into a logistic\nregression model to determine the significant predictors for remission at 2\nyears.\nRESULTS: The delay to therapy (cut point of 4 months) was the only significant\npredictor for remission in patients treated using the single-DMARD strategy,\nwhile no variable was a significant predictor for remission in those treated\nusing the combination-DMARD strategy. The frequency of achieving remission in the\ncombination-DMARD group after 2 years was similar in patients with short (0-4\nmonths) and long (>4 months) delay periods (11 of 26 patients and 22 of 53\npatients, respectively [approximately 42% in each group]), while the\ncorresponding frequencies in the single-DMARD group were 8 of 23 patients (35%)\nand 7 of 63 patients (11%) (P = 0.021). The presence of a shared epitope was not \nrelated to the induction of remission.\nCONCLUSION: The delay of a few months from the onset of symptoms to institution\nof therapy decreases the ability of the traditional single-drug strategy to\ninduce remission in early RA.\n\nPMID: 11953964  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The current\nstudy was conducted to investigate whether the benefits of COBRA therapy were\nsustained over time, and to determine which baseline factors could predict\noutcome.\nMETHODS: All patients had participated in the 56-week COBRA trial. During\nfollowup, they were seen by their own rheumatologists and were also assessed\nregularly by study nurses; no treatment protocol was specified. Disease activity,\nradiologic damage, and functional ability were the primary outcome domains. Two\nindependent assessors scored radiographs in sequence according to the Sharp/van\nder Heijde method. Outcomes were analyzed by generalized estimating equations on \nthe basis of intent-to-treat, starting with data obtained at the last visit of\nthe COBRA trial (56 weeks after baseline).\nRESULTS: At the beginning of followup, patients in the COBRA group had a\nsignificantly lower mean time-averaged 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28)\nand a significantly lower median radiologic damage (Sharp) score compared with\nthose in the SSZ monotherapy group. The functional ability score (Health\nAssessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) was similar in both groups. During the 4-5 year\nfollowup period, the time-averaged DAS28 decreased 0.17 points per year in the\nSSZ group and 0.07 in the COBRA group. The Sharp progression rate was 8.6 points \nper year in the SSZ group and 5.6 in the COBRA group. After adjustment for\ndifferences in treatment and disease activity during followup, the between-group \ndifference in the rate of radiologic progression was 3.7 points per year. The HAQ\nscore did not change significantly over time. Independent baseline predictors of \nradiologic progression over time (apart from treatment allocation) were\nrheumatoid factor positivity, Sharp score, and DAS28.\nCONCLUSION: An initial 6-month cycle of intensive combination treatment that\nincludes high-dose corticosteroids results in sustained suppression of the rate\nof radiologic progression in patients with early RA, independent of subsequent\nantirheumatic therapy.\n\nPMID: 11840436  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Prednisolone and\nMTX were tapered and stopped after weeks 28 and 40, respectively, while SSZ was\ncontinued. Urine and serum samples were collected at baseline and weeks 16, 28,\n40 and 56. Measurements of urinary pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD)\nand serum alkaline phosphatase (tAP) and osteocalcin (OC) were performed, as well\nas standard clinimetry and bone densitometry.\nRESULTS: Over time and in both treatment groups, bone formation and bone\nresorption markers showed a pattern similar to erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR): a significant decrease compared with baseline and a larger decrease with\ncombined treatment at weeks 16 and 28. PYD excretion, tAP, OC, and joint damage\nscores were significantly lower in the combined treatment group. Changes in bone \ndensity (of spine and hips) did not significantly differ between treatment\ngroups. Mainly cumulative ESR explained progression of joint damage.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prednisolone and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy in\npatients with early and active RA are both independently associated with\ndecreased levels of urinary excretion of bone collagen resorption markers PYD and\nDPD. Markers of bone formation and resorption closely followed changes in ESR in \nboth treatment groups. Reduced bone resorption together with reduced bone\nformation-initially at a somewhat faster pace-resulted in less bone turnover and \nexplain the observed (non-significant and partially reversible) extra bone loss\nin the lumbar spine associated with prednisolone (combined treatment).\n\nPMID: 11709606  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the context of a trial in early RA, we studied the relationship between \nclinical signs in individual joints and their propensity to develop progressive\ndamage.METHODS: The COBRA (Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis)\nmulticenter trial compared the efficacy of prednisolone, methotrexate, and\nsulfasalazine against sulfasalazine alone in 155 patients with early RA. Two\nblinded observers interpreted radiographs in sequence (using the Sharp/Van der\nHeijde scoring system); in each center, one blinded observer performed clinical\nassessments every 3 months. The current analysis is based on clinical and\nradiologic data of the individual metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal\ninterphalangeal (PIP) joints of 135 patients. Conditional stepwise logistic\nregression analyzed the relationship between damage (progression) and clinical\nsigns at baseline and followup for each of these joints individually in each\npatient.\nRESULTS: Combination therapy strongly retarded the progression of damage.\nProgression was stronger in patients with rheumatoid factor, HLA-DR4, and high\nlevels of disease activity at baseline. At baseline, 6% of the MCP and PIP joints\nshowed damage; after 1 year, disease had progressed in 10% of these joints.\nBaseline damage, swelling, or pain in a joint independently and strongly\npredicted the progression of damage in that joint (P < 0.001). Each additional\npoint in the swelling score (range 0-2) tripled the risk for subsequent\nprogression. Each additional point on the Sharp scale (range 0-8 per joint) and\neach additional point on the pain scale (range 0-3) doubled the risk. The mean\npain and swelling scores over the year were even stronger predictors of damage.\nCONCLUSION: Local expression of early RA disease activity, both at baseline and\nat 1-year followup, is strongly related to progression of damage in the\nindividual joint.\n\nPMID: 11665964  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of leflunomide and\nsulfasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis over a two year follow up period.\nMETHODS: 358 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in a double blind trial were\nrandomly allocated to receive either leflunomide 20 mg/day, placebo, or\nsulfasalazine 2 g/day. Those completing six months of treatment (n=230) were\ngiven the option to continue in 12 (n=168) and 24 (n=146) month double blinded\nextensions; the placebo group switched to sulfasalazine. This report compares\nefficacy and safety of leflunomide with sulfasalazine in the 6, 12, and 24 month \npatient cohorts.\nRESULTS: The efficacy seen at six months was maintained at 12 and 24 months.\nTwenty four month cohorts on leflunomide showed significant improvement compared \nwith sulfasalazine in doctor (-1.46 v -1.11, p=0.03) and patient (-1.61 v -1.04, \np<0.001) global assessments, ACR20% response (82% v 60%, p<0.01), and functional \nability (Deltamean HAQ -0.65 v -0.36, p=0.0149; DeltaHAQ disability index -0.89 v\n-0.60, p=0.059). Improvement in other variables was comparable for the two drugs,\nincluding slowing of disease progression. Improved HAQ scores in 6, 12, and 24\nmonth leflunomide cohorts were seen in both non-responders (24%, 29%, 35%,\nrespectively v sulfasalazine 8%, 10%, 27%) and ACR20% responders (leflunomide\n63%, 62%, 66% v sulfasalazine 50%, 64%, 44%).

The current study compared\nfunctional disability in cohorts of patients with RA from the initial study who\nvolunteered to continue treatment with leflunomide or sulfasalazine.\nMETHODS: The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was used to assess functional \nability in patients completing 6 months of therapy who chose to continue in\ndouble blinded 12 and 24 month extensions. Patients on active regimens continued \ntaking leflunomide 20 mg/day or sulfasalazine 2 g/day; those taking placebo were \nswitched at Month 6 to sulfasalazine.\nRESULTS: Leflunomide significantly improved patients' functional ability compared\nto placebo (p < or = 0.0001) and sulfasalazine (p < or = 0.01) at 6 months. These\nchanges were seen as early as Month 1, and continued improvements were seen in 12\nand 24 month cohorts. Mean HAQ scores were significantly improved with\nleflunomide compared with sulfasalazine at 24 months (-0.65 vs -0.36; p =\n0.0149); corresponding changes in HAQ Disability Index (DI) were -0.73 vs -0.56\nand were not statistically different. Leflunomide is safe and well tolerated and \nno unexpected adverse events were noted during the 2 year period; diarrhea,\nnausea, and alopecia were less frequent with continued treatment.\nCONCLUSION: These longterm data confirm leflunomide improves functional ability\nas shown by reductions in HAQ scores. The benefit of leflunomide is reflected in \nother efficacy criteria, such as global assessments and the American College of\nRheumatology response rates, all of which showed significantly more improvement\nwith leflunomide than sulfasalazine at 24 months.\n\nPMID: 11550964  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Patients in group I received a standard \ntreatment of intramuscular methotrexate (CAS 59-05-2; 12.5 mg/week), oral\nsulphasalazine (CAS 599-79-1; 0.5 g b.i.d.) and indometacin (CAS 53-86-1; 100 mg \nsuppository at bed-time). In group II the patients received the standard\ntreatment plus a combination of antioxidants. Patients in group III received a\nhigh dose of vitamin E (400 mg t.i.d.) in addition to the standard treatment. The\ndisease state was evaluated using Ritchle's articular score index and the\nduration of morning stiffness. Laboratory evaluations included the rheumatoid\nfactor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma levels of vitamin E and\nmalonedialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). In the \ngroup receiving the standard regimen, the patients started to feel tangible\nimprovement by the end of the second month. With adjuvant therapy of either the\nantioxidant combination or a high dose of vitamin E the symptoms of arthritis\nwere better controlled from the first month. By the end of the second month, the \nvalues of the three monitoring tests were significantly decreased indicating\nbetter control of the disease. The percentage increase in the activity of GPx was\nhighest in patients taking the antioxidant combination and least in those taking \nthe standard treatment. The decrease in plasma MDA followed the same pattern.\nWith adjuvant therapy, the vitamin E level in plasma increased with the duration \nof treatment. The results obtained in the present study are encouraging. The\nclinical improvement and the shift in the disease indices towards normal make the\nuse of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy in rheumatoid disease worth pursuing.\n\nPMID: 11367869  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The result is dependent on\nwhether the underlying measure has a score that increases or decreases on\nimprovement. We examined the importance of this effect in the application of the \nACR improvement criteria.\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from the COBRA trial, in which 155 patients with\nearly active RA had been randomized to receive either combination treatment with \nstep-down prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine or sulfasalazine alone.\nPatient and physician global assessments were recoded to reflect decreasing\nscores on improvement. The effects of this difference in scoring systems were\ncompared among 3 response criteria levels (20%, 50%, and 70%) that are currently \nbeing used to assess improvement in RA clinical trials.\nRESULTS: Analyses showed that the effects of a decreasing, versus increasing,\nscore on the designation of improvement cannot be ignored, especially at higher\npercentages of improvement (e.g., 50%, 70%).\nCONCLUSION: We recommend that percentage improvement in RA be calculated only on \nscores that decrease on improvement. When necessary, raw data should be recoded\nbefore the ACR improvement criteria are applied.\n\nPMID: 11352236  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The \npresent open, controlled study was designed to assess whether a combination of\nSAARDs offer any added benefit. Fifty-four adult RA patients were randomly\nallocated to methotrexate (MTX) (n = 27) and MTX plus sulphasalazine (SSZ) (n =\n27) groups. The subjects were followed-up fortnightly for four weeks then monthly\nfor six months. The disease activity was assessed with the help of 10 clinical\nand four laboratory indices. The improvement was graded as: minor, mild decreases\nin indices, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) continued, physician's\nglobal assessment (PGA) decreased by one; marked, acceptable decreases in\nindices, NSAIDs being taken sparingly, PGA decreased by at least 2, and complete,\nall indices normalised and patients discontinued NSAIDs completely. The\nimprovement was considered clinically important when marked or complete\nimprovement occurred. Adverse drug reactions resulted in withdrawal of 4 subjects\nfrom the MTX + SSZ group and 1 from the control groups. Four and three subjects\nin the combined and MTX groups respectively were lost to follow-up. Subjects in\nboth groups showed significant decline in all indices except hemoglobin and\nneutrophil count. The differences between the two groups in the pre-treatment and\npost-treatment values were insignificant. Complete, marked, minor and no\nimprovement occurred in 4 (21%), 12 (63%), 3 (16%) & 0 in the MTX and in 11\n(48%), 7 (30%), 4 (17%) & 1 (4%) in MTX + SSZ groups respectively. The\ndifferences in the rates of complete and clinically important improvement between\nthe two groups were insignificant (P 0.1398 and 0.7092). The incidence of side\neffects was insignificantly higher in the MTX + SSZ group. Most of them were mild\nand transient. The combination of SAARDs offered little added advantage in RA.\nHowever, the higher rate of complete improvement in the combination group\njustifies trials including larger samples.\n\nPMID: 11192489  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A randomized study of\ntreatment with methotrexate, cyclosporin A, and intraarticular corticosteroids\ncompared with sulfasalazine alone.\n\nProudman SM(1), Conaghan PG, Richardson C, Griffiths B, Green MJ, McGonagle D,\nWakefield RJ, Reece RJ, Miles S, Adebajo A, Gough A, Helliwell P, Martin M,\nHuston G, Pease C, Veale DJ, Isaacs J, van der Heijde DM, Emery P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)University of Leeds, UK.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether a regimen of methotrexate, cyclosporin A, and\ncorticosteroids introduced at onset in poor-prognosis rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\ncan produce a significant improvement in outcome compared with standard\nmonotherapy with sulfasalazine (SSZ).\nMETHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients presenting with new, untreated RA of\nless than 12 months\' duration who fulfilled criteria for poor long-term outcome\nwere randomized to receive either combination therapy (n = 40) or SSZ alone (n = \n42). The primary outcome measures were remission and American College of\nRheumatology (ACR) criteria for 20% improvement at 48 weeks.\nRESULTS: After 48 weeks, the numbers of patients who met the ACR criteria for 20%\nimprovement were not significantly different between the two groups (combination \n58% versus SSZ 45%), and similar numbers of patients had persisting clinical\nremission (approximately 10% both groups). During the first 3 months, there were \nsignificantly greater reductions in parameters of disease activity in the\ncombination group. By 24 weeks, the swollen and tender joint counts, C-reactive\nprotein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates had fallen significantly in\nboth groups, with a greater improvement in the swollen and tender joint count in \nthe combination group. At 48 weeks, the radiographic damage score had increased\nby a median of 1 (range 0-42.5) in the combination group and 1.25 (range 0-72.5) \nin the SSZ group (P = 0.28; although there were significant differences in the\nscores for the right hand). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to\nlack of efficacy in the combination group than in the SSZ group (1 of 40 versus\n10 of 42; P = 0.007). In the combination group, dose reduction was needed in\n22.5% because of hypertension and in 22.5% because of elevated creatinine levels.\nOver 48 weeks, serum creatinine increased in both groups, but particularly in the\ncombination arm.\nCONCLUSION: In poor-prognosis RA patients, "aggressive" combination therapy led\nto more rapid disease suppression but did not result in significantly better ACR \nresponse or remission rates. This suggests that in poor-prognosis disease, an\napproach based on identifying patients with poor treatment responses before extra\ntherapy is added ("step-up" approach) may be more appropriate than the use of\ncombination therapy in all patients from the outset.\n\nPMID: 10943871  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Comparisons included two \nyears of follow up.\nRESULTS: All SAARD strategies reduced mean disease activity. A greater percentage\nof patients improved clinically with strategies II and III than with strategy I: \npercentages of patients improved on joint score with strategies II and III (79%\nand 82%, respectively), which was statistically different from strategy I (66%). \nThe same was true for remission percentages: 31% and 24% v 16%, respectively).\nLongitudinal analysis showed significantly less disability with strategy III, and\na lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate with strategy II than with strategy I. In \naddition, radiological damage after one and two years, was significantly lower in\nstrategies II and III (at two years median scores were 11 and 10 v 14 in strategy\nI, p<0.05). Toxicity was increased in strategy II compared with the other\nstrategies.\nCONCLUSION: Strategy III, comprising methotrexate or sulfasalazine, produced the \nbest results weighing effectiveness and toxicity. Strategy I (hydroxychloroquine \nor auranofin) was slightly less effective, and strategy II (intramuscular gold or\nD-penicillamine) was associated with increased toxicity.\n\nPMCID: PMC1753160\nPMID: 10834865  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Leflunomide Rheumatoid Arthritis\nInvestigators Group.\n\nSharp JT(1), Strand V, Leung H, Hurley F, Loew-Friedrich I.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Clinical Research/Development, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ\n08807-0800, USA.\n\nErratum in\n    Arthritis Rheum 2000 Jun;43(6):1345.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with leflunomide (LEF), methotrexate\n(MTX), or sulfasalazine (SSZ) for 6-12 months retards progression of radiographic\ndamage and to identify clinical variables that correlate with radiographic\nprogression.\nMETHODS: Radiographs of the hands and feet were performed at baseline and at the \nend of study or early exit in 3 randomized controlled trials. Protocol US301 was \na 12-month controlled trial of LEF or MTX treatment compared with placebo in 482 \npatients randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio. Protocol MN301 compared 6 months of LEF or \nSSZ treatment with placebo in 358 patients, randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio, with\ncontinued blinded treatment in the active control arms for 12 months. Protocol\nMN302 compared 12 months of LEF treatment with MTX in 999 patients. Radiographs\nwere blinded for sequence and treatment and were scored for erosions and joint\nspace narrowing. All analyses were by intent-to-treat. Sensitivity analyses were \nperformed to account for missing data.\nRESULTS: LEF, MTX, and SSZ treatment resulted in statistically significantly less\nradiographic progression compared with placebo at 6 and 12 months: for protocol\nUS301, LEF versus placebo P = 0.0007 and MTX versus placebo P = 0.0196; for\nprotocol MN301, LEF versus placebo P = 0.0004 and SSZ versus placebo P = 0.0484. \nThe effect of LEF treatment was similar to that of MTX and SSZ.\nCONCLUSION: These are the first 6- and 12-month randomized placebo- and active\ndrug-controlled trials to demonstrate retardation of radiographic progression by \na new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), LEF, as well as 2 commonly\nused DMARDs, MTX and SSZ.\n\nPMID: 10728741  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It results in\nincreased levels of work disability and high medical costs. A new goal of RA\ntherapy is to reduce or prevent functional disability. Patients' perception of\noverall health status in RA was assessed using several instruments (HAQ, MHAQ,\nSF-36, and PET) in Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials \ncomparing the new DMARD, leflunomide to sulfasalazine and methotrexate.\nLeflunomide significantly improved patient quality of life compared to placebo in\nboth the European (P = 0.0001) and North American (P = 0.0001) studies. Reduction\nin HAQ scores with leflunomide (-0.50 vs -0.29; P = 0.0086) was significantly\ngreater than sulfasalazine. Leflunomide also significantly reduced MHAQ scores\nversus methotrexate (-0.29 vs -0.15; P < or = 0.05). These changes were seen as\nearly as Week 4. These results highlight the efficacy of leflunomide in RA\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 10668524  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Disease progression as \nassessed by radiographic imaging of structural joint damage is a key outcome\nmeasure in RA. Joint damage is especially rapid during early phases of RA, thus\nthe current trend of early aggressive therapy with disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Radiographic analysis of disease progression with\nthe novel DMARD leflunomide was compared to methotrexate and sulfasalazine in two\nlarge, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase III studies (N = 580). The results as\nindicated by changes in x-ray scores indicate that leflunomide and both active\ncomparators slow disease progression significantly better than placebo (P < or = \n0.01). Slowing of disease progression with leflunomide was similar to\nsulfasalazine at 6 months but better than methotrexate (P < or = 0.049) at 12\nmonths. These data verify the ability of leflunomide to slow disease progression \nand confirm its disease-modifying potential.\n\nPMID: 10668522  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Thus, despite the\nlimited data on the therapeutic efficacy of combination therapies, many patients \nare currently treated with a combination of DMARDs.\nMETHODS: We studied prospectively the efficacy of combination therapy with\nDMARDs. The study was designed as a randomized trial and a single DMARD or two or\nthree DMARD combinations were administered to 180 consecutive, age- and\nsex-matched patients with active RA, each of whom was followed up for a period of\n2 years under treatment. Patients were divided into 3 groups which did not differ\nwith regard to demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Patients in group\nI were treated with a single DMARD [methotrexate (MTX) 7.5-15 mg/week or\nsulfasalazine (SSZ) 1-2 g/day or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg/day], group II\nwith MTX + SSZ or MTX + HCQ, and group III with a combination of all three drugs.\nPatients were re-evaluated at regular intervals by means of clinical and\nbiochemical tests designed to detect specific rheumatic activity. Radiological\nassessments were also performed and scored according to Larsen by the same\nradiologist who was blinded to the treatment groups.\nRESULTS: At the end of the trial there were significant improvements in the\nclinical and laboratory parameters in all 3 groups. However, improvements were\ngreater and much more significant in the patients who were given combination\ntherapies. The combination of MTX + SSZ + HCQ was more effective than both\nmonotherapy and the two-drug combinations.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, we suggest that patients with RA should be treated\nwith combinations of DMARDs.\n\nPMID: 10609068  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Its application for\njuvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) is limited so far and controversial results for \nthe efficacy of this therapy have been published. We studied the efficacy and\ntolerance of the sulphasalazine treatment in 32 patients with JCA (10 with\npolyarthritis, 21 with pauciarthritis and 1 with systemic form). Our results\nrevealed significant response of the treatment at the end of the 6th month in\n24/31 patients (77%). In one patient the treatment was discontinued because of\ntransitory neutropenia at the end of the 1st month. No significant difference was\nobserved between the efficacy of the treatment in the polyarticular and\npauciarticular disease, as well as newly-diagnosed cases and those with\nlongstanding disease. From the group of 17 children treated up to the end of the \n1st year 88% achieved complete remission. No serious toxic effects were observed,\nwith the exception of two cases with transitory low-grade neutropenia.

The cohorts were followed up prospectively and\ntreated with available DMARDs. The radiographic outcomes of 103 and 85\nseropositive cohort patients from Heinola and Jyv\xc3\xa4skyl\xc3\xa4 respectively were\nassigned Larsen scores (0-100) for their wrist, hand and foot radiographs in\nyears 0, 1, 3, and 8, and compared with each other.\nRESULTS: In this study it was seen that DMARD treatment for RA became more\nextensive over time. The earlier cohort patients were treated with gold sodium\nthiomalate, chloroquine and D-penicillamine, while 8 additional DMARDs and\nvarious DMARD combinations were used for the later cohort patients. At the 8 year\nvisit, 23%, 33%, and 2% of the Heinola patients, and 6%, 45%, and 21% of the\nJyv\xc3\xa4skyl\xc3\xa4 patients respectively were being treated with chloroquine, other single\nDMARDs, or DMARD combinations. Destruction in the peripheral joints remained\nlower in the more extensively treated cohort; from 0 to 8 years the median Larsen\nscore increased from 1 to 25.5 and from 0 to 12 (p = 0.001) for the Heinola and\nthe Jyv\xc3\xa4skyl\xc3\xa4 patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Our result supports a role of DMARDs in preventing joint destruction \nin RA in the long-term.\n\nPMID: 10544834  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Forty five patients with early, active\nrheumatoid arthritis, (RA) were treated with CyA and SASP combination therapy for\n12 months. The patients were evaluated by disease activity and radiologic\nmeasurements. The combined CyA and SASP therapy seems to be effective. Disease\nactivity parameters improved within 3 months. The individual treatment response\nrate according to EULAR response criteria was 78% after a one year treatment\nperiod. Five patients were withdrawn due to gastrointestinal side effect and two \npatients because of lack of efficacy. CyA and SASP combination treatment seems to\nbe effective in early severe RA, and with careful monitoring, side effects can be\nkept under control.\n\nPMID: 10503557  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of\neither EULAR good responders 34%, 38%, 38% or ACR criteria responders 59%, 59%,\n65% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively. Radiological progression\nevaluated by the modified Sharp score was very modest in the three groups: mean\nchanges in erosion score: +2.4, +2.4, +1.9, in narrowing score: +2.3, +2.1, +1.6 \nand in total damage score: +4.6, +4.5, +3.5, in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX\ngroups respectively. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SASP + MTX\ngroup 91% versus 75% in the SASP and MTX group (p = 0.025). Nausea was the most\nfrequent side effect: 32%, 23%, 49% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups\nrespectively (p = 0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that an early initiation therapy of disease\nmodifying drug seems to be of benefit. However, this study was unable to\ndemonstrate a clinically relevant superiority of the combination therapy although\nseveral outcomes were in favour of this observation. The tolerability of the\nthree treatment modalities seems acceptable.\n\nPMCID: PMC1752864\nPMID: 10364900  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Plasma homocysteine, serum folate\nconcentrations, and vitamin B12 were measured. The influence of the C677T\nmutation of the enzyme methyl-enetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR) gene was\nanalysed.\nRESULTS: A slight trend towards increased efficacy and an increased occurrence of\nminor gastrointestinal toxicity was present in the COMBI group, no differences\nexisted clinically between SSZ and MTX. Only a slight and temporary increase in\nplasma homocysteine was found in the SSZ group, in contrast with the persistent\nrise in the MTX group and the even greater increase in the COMBI patients.\nPatients homozygous for the mutation in the MTHFR gene had significantly higher\nbaseline homocysteine, heterozygous MTHFR genotype induced a significantly higher\nplasma homoeysteine at week 52 compared with no mutation. No correlation was\nfound between clinical efficacy variables and homocysteine. Patients with\ngastrointestinal toxicity had a significantly greater increase in homocysteine.\nCONCLUSION: A persistent increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations was\nobserved in patients treated with MTX alone and more pronounced in combination\nwith SSZ, in contrast with SSZ alone. An increase in plasma homocysteine is\nrelated to the C677T mutation in MTHFR. A relation in the change in homocysteine \nconcentrations with (gastrointestinal) toxicity was found, no relation with\nclinical efficacy existed.\n\nPMCID: PMC1752831\nPMID: 10343521  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

This multicentre, randomised trial with 2-year follow-up sought\nevidence on the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy (sulphasalazine,\nmethotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone) compared with treatment with \na single disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, with or without prednisolone, in\nthe treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis.\nMETHODS: 199 patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. 195 started\nthe treatment (97 received combination and 98 single drug therapy). Single-drug\ntherapy in all patients started with sulphasalazine; in 51 patients methotrexate \nwas later substituted. Oral prednisolone was required by 63 patients. The primary\noutcome measure was induction of remission. Analyses were intention to treat.\nFINDINGS: 87 patients in the combination group and 91 in the single-therapy group\ncompleted the trial. After a year, remission was achieved in 24 of 97 patients\nwith combination therapy, and 11 of 98 with single-drug therapy (p=0.011). The\nremission frequencies at 2 years were 36 of 97 and 18 of 98 (p=0.003). Clinical\nimprovement (American College of Rheumatology criteria of 50% clinical response) \nwas achieved after 1 year in 68 (75%) patients with combination therapy, and in\n56 (60%) using single-drug therapy (p=0.028), while at the 2-year visit 69 and 57\nrespectively (71% vs 58%, p=0.058) had clinically improved. The frequencies of\nadverse events were similar in both treatment groups.\nINTERPRETATION: Combination therapy was better and not more hazardous than single\ntreatment in induction of remission in early rheumatoid arthritis. The\ncombination strategy as an initial therapy seems to increase the efficacy of the \ntreatment in at least a proportion of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPMID: 10334255  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

No effect\nevident in a prospective randomised trial of 200 rheumatoid patients treated with\nsulphasalazine or auranofin over five years.\n\nGordon MM(1), Porter DR, Capell HA.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow.\n\nBACKGROUND: Sulphasalazine (SSZ) has been reported to cause drug induced systemic\nlupus erythematosus (SLE), but diagnosis of this complication in the context of\nrheumatoid arthritis (RA) is difficult.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine prospectively: (1) if patients become seropositive for\nantinuclear antibodies (ANA) during prolonged treatment with SSZ without clinical\nevidence of SLE; (2) if ANA positive patients develop more adverse reactions than\nANA negative patients; (3) if drug induced SLE was identified in this cohort.\nMETHODS: 200 patients enrolled in a randomised prospective trial of SSZ and\nauranofin (AUR) were followed up for five years. Baseline and annual ANA results \nwere collected along with information on drug toxicity and reasons for\ndiscontinuation of treatment.\nRESULTS: Over five years 24 patients stopped taking SSZ and 49 AUR because of\nside effects. Of the features common to SLE, rash developed in nine SSZ patients \nand 11 AUR treated patients and mouth ulcers in three and four patients\nrespectively. Six SSZ treated patients and three treated with AUR developed\nleucopenia, which promptly resolved with drug withdrawal. No adverse event was\nascribed to drug induced SLE. Of the 72 SSZ treated patients who were ANA\nnegative or weakly positive at outset, 14 (19%) became strongly ANA positive\ncompared with 11 (14%) of 80 AUR patients. Patients ANA positive at baseline or\nwho became ANA positive were not more likely to develop drug toxicity or to\nwithdraw from treatment than those ANA negative throughout.\nCONCLUSION: ANA positivity is common in patients with RA, but the presence or\ndevelopment of ANA did not increase the likelihood of withdrawing from treatment.\nNo case of drug induced SLE was seen over five years in this study.\n\nPMCID: PMC1752876\nPMID: 10225813  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Such criteria depend on the definition of \nwhat constitutes the minimum clinically important progression of damage. Because \nsuch a definition is currently not available, as a first step we have used the\nconcept of random measurement error to determine what is the smallest detectable \ndifference (SDD) in radiological progression between 2 radiographs of a\nparticular patient. Baseline and 12 month radiographs (hands, wrists, feet) of 52\npatients representative of the spectrum of radiological progression were selected\nfrom a randomized controlled trial of early rheumatoid arthritis (COBRA study)\nand were read paired and chronologically by 2 observers using the van der Heijde \nmodified Sharp method (0-448 scale) and another 2 observers using the Scott\nmodified Larsen method (0-200). The measurement error of progression was\ndetermined using the metric 95% limits of agreement method of Bland and Altman.\nIn the setting of early RA the SDD is 11 modified Sharp score units and 8\nmodified Larsen score units if there is an equal distribution of baseline damage \nand progression in the sample and the mean score of the same trained observers is\nalways used. The SDD is 15.5 modified Sharp score units and 11 modified Larsen\nscore units if there is an equal distribution of baseline damage and progression \nin the sample and the mean score of any 2 trained observers is used. Other SDD\nwere determined depending on the context of measurement. Although this exercise\nneeds repetition in other settings, the SDD is a useful starting point in the\ndevelopment of radiological response criteria.\n\nPMID: 10090192  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Only self-efficacy correlated with compliance (r = 0.58; P < 0.001). The \nlogistical regression analysis identified self-efficacy as the only factor\ndetermining > or = 80% adherence (P = 0.01).

This double-blind\nrandomised trial compared leflunomide with placebo and sulphasalazine in active\nrheumatoid arthritis.\nMETHODS: 358 patients were randomly assigned leflunomide (100 mg daily on days\n1-3, then 20 mg daily), placebo, or sulphasalazine (0.5 g daily, titrated\nprogressively to 2.0 g daily at week 4). The primary endpoints were tender and\nswollen joint counts and investigator's and patient's overall assessments.\nAnalyses were by intention to treat.\nFINDINGS: The mean changes in the leflunomide, placebo, and sulphasalazine groups\nwere -9.7, -4.3, and -8.1 for tender joint count; -7.2, -3.4, and -6.2 for\nswollen joint count; -1.1, -0.3, and -1.0 for physician's overall assessment; and\n-1.1, -0.4, and -1.1 for patient's overall assessment. Leflunomide and\nsulphasalazine were significantly superior to placebo (p=0.0001 for joint counts;\np<0.001 for assessments). Radiographic disease progression was significantly\nslower with leflunomide and sulphasalazine than with placebo (p<0.01). Most\ncommon adverse events with leflunomide were diarrhoea (17%), nausea (10%),\nalopecia (8%), and rash (10%). Transiently abnormal liver function was seen in\nthree leflunomide-group patients and five sulphasalazine-group patients. There\nwere two cases of reversible agranulocytosis in the sulphasalazine group.\nINTERPRETATION: Leflunomide was more effective than placebo in treatment of\nrheumatoid arthritis and showed similar efficacy to sulphasalazine. Leflunomide\nwas well tolerated. This drug may be a useful option as a disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drug.\n\nPMID: 9929017  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The mean total costs per patient in the first 56 weeks of\nfollow-up were $5519 for combined treatment and $6511 for treatment with\nsulphasalazine alone (P = 0.37). Out-patient care, in-patient care and non-health\ncare each contributed about one-third to the total costs. The combined-treatment \ngroup appeared to generate savings in the length of hospital stay for RA,\nnon-protocol drugs and costs of home help, but comparisons were not statistically\nsignificant. Protocol drugs and monitoring were slightly more expensive in the\ncombined-treatment group. Clinical, radiographic and functional outcomes\nsignificantly favoured combined treatment at week 28 (radiography also at week\n56). Utility scores also favoured combined treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Combined treatment is cost-effective due to enhanced efficacy at\nlower or equal direct costs.\n\nPMID: 9825750  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

MRI studies were performed at\n6-month intervals on a subset of 89 patients.\nRESULTS: Sulfasalazine failed to slow or prevent disability progression as\nmeasured by the primary outcome (confirmed worsening of the Expanded Disability\nStatus Scale [EDSS] score by at least 1.0 point on two consecutive 3-month\nvisits). Sulfasalazine influenced favorably a number of secondary outcomes during\nthe first 18 months of the trial (e.g., annualized relapse rate, proportion of\nrelapse-free patients; progressive subgroup only: rate of EDSS progression at 1\nand 2 years, median time to EDSS progression) but these positive findings were\nnot sustained into the second half of the trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sulfasalazine does not prevent EDSS score progression in the subset \nof MS patients studied by this protocol. Treatments may improve relapse-related\noutcomes in MS, at least temporarily, without providing sustained slowing of EDSS\nprogression. Phase III MS trials should be of sufficient length to determine a\nmeaningful impact on disease course.\n\nPMID: 9818858  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Subjects were 200 patients \nwith rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with established disease. In this "true to life"\napproach, comorbidity was not an exclusion criterion unless it prejudiced\nassessment of drug toxicity. The main outcome measure was the Health Assessment\nQuestionnaire (HAQ) functional score.\nRESULTS: Over 12 year followup 95 (47.5%) patients died; this was the commonest\nreason for study groups being unfulfilled. There was one drug related death\n(methotrexate). Patients who were socially disadvantaged were more likely to die \nprematurely. HAQ did not deteriorate significantly in those who continued taking \ntheir original DMARD, or in the SASP intention-to-treat group over 12 years.\nSustained suppression of disease activity was possible in the entire group\navailable for followup at 12 years. Most toxicity occurred early and no\nunexpected side effects were observed.\nCONCLUSION: High premature mortality in RA was confirmed and an association\nbetween mortality and deprivation was demonstrated. Sustained reduction in acute \nphase response was possible using sequential single DMARD. This study provides\nuseful baseline and longterm information against which to evaluate combination\ntherapy or new agents.\n\nPMID: 9779839  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Both\nEuropean League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology\ndefinitions of response, with comprehensive as well as simplified joint counts,\nwere calculated. We studied the differences between the criteria with and without\nsimplified joint counts, the discriminating capacity between treatment groups,\nand the association with change in functional capacity and joint damage.\nRESULTS: Response criteria that included 28-joint counts classified patients'\nresponses more conservatively. No differences between treatment groups were found\nwith either set of response criteria. The association with change in functional\ncapacity was significant in all cases. All response criteria were significantly\nassociated with radiographic progression of RA.\nCONCLUSION: Improvement criteria that include 28-joint counts are as valid as the\noriginal improvement criteria that included more comprehensive joint counts.\n\nPMID: 9778226  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The\nexperimental group followed an education programme. All patients started on\nsulphasalazine therapy. Compliance with sulphasalazine was measured by pill\ncounting. Compliance rates with regimens of physical exercise, endurance\nactivities, and energy conservation were measured by questionnaires. Compliance\nwith prescriptions of joint protection was scored using a test for joint\nprotection performance. Health was measured by a Disease Activity Score (function\nof erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Ritchie score, and number of swollen joints), \nC reactive protein, Dutch-AIMS scores, and M-HAQ scores, range of motion of\nshoulder, elbow, and knee joints. Parameters were scored at baseline and after\nthree, six, and 12 months.\nRESULTS: Sixty of 65 patients gave informed consent, five of them withdrew from\nfollow up. Compliance with sulphasalazine exceeded 80% with no differences\nbetween groups. Compliance with physical exercise (at three months), energy\nconservation (at three and at 12 months), and joint protection (at three months) \nimproved significantly more in the experimental group. The improvements of health\nwere not different in the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Compliance with sulphasalazine among patients with active, recent\nonset RA is high, whether formal patient education is followed or not. Compliance\nwith physical exercise, energy conservation, and joint protection was increased\nby patient education.

Dutch Juvenile Chronic\nArthritis Study Group.\n\nvan Rossum MA(1), Fiselier TJ, Franssen MJ, Zwinderman AH, ten Cate R, van\nSuijlekom-Smit LW, van Luijk WH, van Soesbergen RM, Wulffraat NM, Oostveen JC,\nKuis W, Dijkstra PF, van Ede CF, Dijkmans BA.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of sulfasalazine\n(SSZ) in the treatment of juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA).\nMETHODS: We conducted a 24-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,\nmulticenter study of patients with active JCA of both oligoarticular and\npolyarticular onset. Patients were treated with a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day of SSZ\n(maximum 2,000 mg/day) or placebo. The efficacy variables were joint scores,\nphysician's, parents', and patient's overall assessments, and laboratory\nparameters of inflammation.\nRESULTS: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 52 (75%) completed the trial. Six patients \n(18%) withdrew from the placebo group, and 11 (31%) withdrew from the SSZ group\n(P = 0.18). In the intention-to-treat analysis of end point efficacy,\nbetween-group differences were significant for the overall articular severity\nscore (P = 0.02), all global assessments (P = 0.01), and the laboratory\nparameters (P < 0.001). Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SSZ group \nand were the main reason for withdrawal (P < 0.001), but in all instances, these \nevents were transient or reversible upon cessation of treatment.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this first placebo-controlled study show that SSZ is\neffective and safe in the treatment of children with oligoarticular- and\npolyarticular-onset JCA, although it was not well tolerated in one-third of the\npatients.\n\nPMID: 9588731  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

One hundred and five patients with\nactive, early RA, rheumatoid factor and/or HLA DR1/4 positive were randomized\nbetween sulphasalazine (SSZ) 2000 (maximum 3000) mg daily, or methotrexate (MTX) \n7.5 (maximum 15) mg weekly, or the combination (COMBI) of both, and were followed\nup by a single observer for 52 weeks. The mean change over time per patient,\nincluding all visits, in Disease Activity Score (DAS) was: SSZ: -1.6 (95% CI -2.0\nto -1.2); MTX: -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4); COMBI: -1.9 (-2.2 to -1.6); the difference\nweek 0-week 52 (SSZ, MTX, COMBI respectively); DAS: -1.8, -2.0, -2.3, Ritchie\narticular index: -9.2, -9.5, -10.6, swollen joints: -9.2, -12.4, -14.3,\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate: -17, -21, -28. Nausea occurred significantly more\nin the COMBI group. The numbers of drop-outs due to toxicity were SSZ 9, MTX 2,\nCOMBI 5. In conclusion, there were no significant differences in efficacy between\ncombination and single therapy, only a modest trend favouring COMBI. The results \nof MTX and SSZ were very comparable. Nausea occurred more often in the COMBI\ngroup: the number of withdrawals due to adverse events did not differ\nsignificantly.\n\nPMID: 9374925  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial (COBRA), \nwe compared the combination of sulphasalazine (2 g/day), methotrexate (7.5\nmg/week), and prednisolone (initially 60 mg/day, tapered in 6 weekly steps to 7.5\nmg/day) with sulphasalazine alone.\nMETHODS: 155 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (median duration 4 months) \nwere randomly assigned combined treatment (76) or sulphasalazine alone (79).\nPrednisolone and methotrexate were tapered and stopped after 28 and 40 weeks,\nrespectively. The main outcomes were the pooled index (a weighted change score of\nfive disease activity measures) and the Sharp/Van der Heijde radiographic damage \nscore in hands and feet. Independent health-care professionals assessed the main \noutcomes without knowledge of treatment allocation.\nFINDINGS: At week 28, the mean pooled index was 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6) in the\ncombined treatment group and 0.8 (0.6-1.0) in the sulphasalazine group (p <\n0.0001). At this time, 55 (72%) and 39 (49%) patients, respectively, were\nimproved according to American College of Rheumatology criteria. The clinical\ndifference between the groups decreased and was no longer significant after\nprednisolone was stopped, and there were no further changes after methotrexate\nwas stopped. At 28 weeks, the radiographic damage score had increased by a median\nof 1 (range 0-28) in the combined-therapy group and 4 (0-44) in the\nsulphasalazine group (p < 0.0001). The increases at week 56 (2 [0-43] vs 6\n[0-54], p = 0.004), and at week 80 (4 [0-80] vs 12 [0-72], p = 0.01) were also\nsignificant. Further analysis suggests that combined therapy immediately\nsuppressed damage progression, whereas sulphasalazine did so less effectively and\nwith a lag of 6 to 12 months. There were fewer withdrawals in the combined\ntherapy than the sulphasalazine group (6 [8%] vs 23 [29%]), and they occurred\nlater.\nINTERPRETATION: This combined-therapy regimen offers additional disease control\nover and above that of sulphasalazine alone that persists for up to a year after \ncorticosteroids are stopped. Although confirmatory studies and long-term\nfollow-up are needed, this approach may prove useful in the treatment of early\nrheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPMID: 9251634  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The response to drug treatment was determined by change in\nplasma viscosity, CRP, early morning stiffness and articular index over a\n10-point scale. Of the 19 patients studied, eight were considered to have\nresponded well to SASP and seven to have responded poorly or not at all. Over the\ntreatment period, plateau levels of superoxide production fell in seven of the\neight responders (P = 0.028) compared with a non-significant fall in 3/7 of the\nnon-responder groups. The initial rate of superoxide production also fell in the \nresponder group, but this was not statistically significant. Initial values in\nboth the responder and non-responder groups were comparable with those seen for\nnormal controls. Analysis of drug levels showed all patients to be compliant with\ndrug treatment; however, drug levels and neutrophil activity were not correlated.\nStudies of the effect of SASP and sulphapyridine on superoxide production in\nvitro showed no difference between good and poor responders. These results\nsuggest that there is no inherent difference between good and poor responders\nregarding the susceptibility of their neutrophils to SASP. SASP's action on\nneutrophils, therefore, appears not to be its main mechanism of disease-modifying\nactivity in RA.\n\nPMID: 9189053  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

All patients experiencing active and/or erosive disease 2 years\nfrom onset were asked to participate in a 2-year placebo-controlled DPA trial.\nPrevious treatment with slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (SAARDs) or oral\ncorticosteroids was not allowed. The main outcome variable was radiographic\nprogression in the hands and feet evaluated according to Larsen. Clinical\nassessment including the Ritchie index, active joint count, and the\nHAQ-disability index was performed every 6th month. Patients were included in the\nanalyses of efficacy until the endpoint of therapy.\nRESULTS: 111/180 patients were eligible for treatment, and 74 agreed to\nparticipate in the trial. 21/33 patients on DPA and 22/41 on placebo completed\nthe study. More patients taking placebo stopped due to lack of response (p <\n0.01). 27% of the patients on DPA were withdrawn due to side effects.\nRadiographic deterioration increased but most clinical variables improved in both\ntrial arms. A large inter-individual variation was observed. The only significant\ndifference in trend over 2 years between DPA and placebo was found for joint\ntenderness. However, the median trends for most clinical variables showed a more \npositive effect for DPA. The 37 patients who refused to participate in the trial \nin general fared somewhat worse than patients taking DPA and somewhat better than\npatients taking placebo. The remission rate was about the same in all 3 groups\n(12-13.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS: About two-thirds of all early definite RA patients were eligible for\ntreatment using current criteria. Psychological readiness for early therapy was\nfairly modest with a high refusal rate. The difference in efficacy between DPA\nand placebo was small, but was in favour of DPA for most clinical variables.\nHowever, only joint tenderness showed a significantly better trend. No\nsignificant slowing of radiographic progression by DPA was found.\n\nPMID: 8978957  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were assessed annually for 5 years, using clinical and\nlaboratory measures of disease activity. Risk of discontinuing treatment was\ncompared using life table analysis.\nRESULTS: 31% of patients continued sulfasalazine for at least 5 years, compared\nto only 15% continuing auranofin (p < 0.05). Patients previously given\nintramuscular (i.m.) gold did particularly badly during auranofin treatment (only\n1/26 continued therapy for 5 years), but after excluding all patients previously \ntreated with i.m. gold from both groups more patients continued sulfasalazine for\n> 5 years (p < 0.05). Patients continuing therapy at 5 years had significantly\nmilder disease at enrollment than those who did not. The patients continuing\nauranofin treatment at 5 years were no better than at the outset of the trial,\nand may represent a subgroup of patients with a good prognosis. Patients\ncontinuing sulfasalazine, however, showed sustained response over the 5 year\nperiod.\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine therapy was more likely to be continued for 5 years,\nsuggesting better tolerability and/or efficacy than auranofin, and produced\nevidence of continuing benefit. Patients previously withdrawn from i.m. gold\ntherapy because of inefficacy or minor toxicity should not be given auranofin\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 8923361  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were enrolled in a\nprospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial of sulfasalazine (SSZ) versus\ngold sodium thiomalate (GSTM), sponsored by the Cooperative Systematic Studies of\nRheumatic Diseases. Using correlation analysis and regression modeling, the\nclinical utility of sIL-2R as a measure of disease activity and predictor of\noutcome was assessed.\nRESULTS: 91 women and 46 men with a mean age of 51 +/- 13 years and mean duration\nof disease of 64 +/- 78 months participated in this study. The mean sIL-2R level \nin all patients with RA was markedly elevated (980 +/- 589 U/ml) compared with\nthat in healthy control subjects (446 +/- 196 U/ml; p = < 0.0001). There was no\ncorrelation between the sIL-2R levels and the joint pain/tenderness count, either\nat study entry or completion. There were significant positive correlations\nbetween the baseline sIL-2R and baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and\nbetween the change in sIL-2R and the change in ESR. Both a multiple linear\nregression model and a multiple logistic regression model showed that baseline\nsIL-2R levels were not predictive of clinical outcome.\nCONCLUSION: sIL-2R levels are significantly elevated in patients with active RA\nand correlate positively with ESR. However, these results indicate that in\npatients with early RA, sIL-2R levels are neither associated with standard\ndisease activity criteria nor predictive of the response to therapy with SSZ or\nGSTM, even after controlling for the simultaneous effects of other important\nclinical variables.\n\nPMID: 8923356  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

To follow and predict the course of the \ndisease in an individual patient, several recognized and proposed prognostic\nmarkers, including markers for disease activity, have been considered. However,\nno individual marker for disease activity has shown satisfactory specificity and \nsensitivity. Thus an index of disease activity combining several variables is\nneeded. Response criteria based on the Disease Activity Score (DAS) were\ndeveloped in an open study of 227 patients with RA of recent onset. Response was \ndefined as a combination of a significant change from baseline and the level of\ndisease activity attained. Good response was defined as a significant decrease in\nDAS (> 1.2) and a low level of disease activity ( < or = 2.4). Non-response was\ndefined as a decrease < or = 0.6, or a decrease > 0.6 and < or = 1.2 with an\nattained DAS > 3.7. Any other scores were regarded as moderate responses. These\nresponse criteria were adopted as the EULAR response criteria and were validated,\ntogether with the WHO/ILAR and ACR response criteria, in a 48 week, double-blind \ntrial comparing hydroxychloroquine and sulphasalazine in 60 patients. Response\nwas evaluated against radiographic damage (construct validity) and functional\ndisability (criterion validity); discriminating capacity was also assessed. EULAR\nresponse criteria showed significant association with X-ray progression and\nfunctional disability, and differentiated between sulphasalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine. ACR and WHO/ILAR response criteria performed less well, only \nshowing good criterion validity. Several groups are working on the prognosis of\nearly RA and have agreed to collaborate to test DAS and other prognostic markers \nto better recognize severe, progressive RA, before joint damage takes place.\n\nPMID: 8810683  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The influence of sulphasalazine (SASP) on the pharmacokinetics of low dose\nmethotrexate (MTX) and the relation between pharmacokinetic variables and\nclinical response was studied in 15 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis\ndespite > 6 months of SASP treatment. 2. SASP was stopped for 2 weeks. Thereafter\na single oral dose of 7.5 mg MTX was administered after a standard breakfast.\nBlood was sampled initially every 30 min, thereafter hourly during 8 h. Urine was\nsampled every hour. Then 2000 mg SASP daily + 7.5 mg MTX weekly was given. After \n4 weeks the same procedure was repeated supplemented with concomitant\nadministration of 1000 mg SASP. Clinical measurements included Ritchie articular \nindex, number of swollen joints, ESR and the disease activity score.\nPharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a two-compartment model with first\norder absorption and lag time.

The responses of patients with rheumatoid arthritis to\ntreatment with a single so-called disease-modifying drug, such as methotrexate,\nare often suboptimal. Despite limited data, many patients are treated with\ncombinations of these drugs.\nMETHODS: We enrolled 102 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and poor responses to\nat least one disease-modifying drug in a two-year, double-blind, randomized study\nof treatment with methotrexate alone (7.5 to 17.5 mg per week), the combination\nof sulfasalazine (500 mg twice daily) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice\ndaily), or all three drugs. The dose of methotrexate was adjusted in an attempt\nto achieve remission in all patients. The primary and point of the study was the \nsuccessful completion of two years of treatment with 50 percent improvement in\ncomposite symptoms of arthritis and no evidence of drug toxicity.\nRESULTS: Fifty of the 102 patients had 50 percent improvement at nine months and \nmaintained at least that degree of improvement for two years without evidence of \nmajor drug toxicity. Among them were 24 of 31 patients treated with all three\ndrugs (77 percent), 12 of 36 patients treated with methotrexate alone (33\npercent, P < 0.001 for the comparison with the three-drug group), and 14 of 35\npatients treated with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (40 percent), P =\n0.003 for the comparison with the three-drug group). Seven patients in the\nmethotrexate group and three patients in each of the other two groups\ndiscontinued treatment because of drug toxicity.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, combination therapy with\nmethotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine is more effective than either\nmethotrexate alone or a combination of sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nPMID: 8609945  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Because of this, most\nrheumatologists are moving to disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)\ntherapy earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate (MTX) has become the initial\nDMARD of choice for most rheumatologists. Unfortunately, treatment of RA with a\nsingle DMARD, including MTX, often results in a suboptimal response. Therefore,\nmost rheumatologists are now using combinations of DMARD to treat patients with\nRA who have had incomplete responses to single DMARD therapy. The Rheumatoid\nArthritis Investigational Network (RAIN) reported the results of a double blind, \ncontrolled comparison of triple drug therapy\n(MTX-sulfasalazine-hydroxychloroquine) against MTX alone, and against the\ncombination of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. Twenty-eight patients who\nhad suboptimal responses to MTX or the combination of sulfasalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine were then treated with triple therapy in an open label study. \nFourteen had previously failed MTX therapy, and 14 had previously failed\ncombination therapy with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Both groups had\nstatistically significant improvements in sedimentation rates, morning stiffness,\nswollen joint scores, tender joint scores, patient global status assessment, and \nphysician global status assessment. Statistical significance was reached for all \nthese variables for patients in both groups, but improvement was greater for the \npatients in the sulfasalazine-hydroxychloroquine group. Patients with RA who have\nhad suboptimal responses to MTX, or to the combination of\nsulfasalazine-hydroxychloroquine, show both statistical and clinically\nsignificant improvement in multiple clinical variables when treated with the\ncombination of MTX 17.5 mg/week, sulfasalazine 500 mg bid, and hydroxychloroquine\n200 mg bid.\n\nPMID: 8833058  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Thirty patients took SSZ as their \nsole drug therapy. One hundred thirty-nine patients with an average age of 11.5\nyrs (range 1.5-21.8 yrs) took the medication. The duration of symptoms at the\nstart of treatment was 30 mo (1-130 mo). All subtypes of JRA were included in the\nstudy group. Patients were treated for a mean of 13 mo (1-42 mo) with 31\nmg/kg/day of SSZ. Significant improvement was defined as 50% decrease in the\nnumber of joints with active arthritis; or 50% decrease in the number of joints\nwith effusion; or 50% decrease in total degrees of joint contractures; or\nnormalization of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate within 12 months of\nstarting treatment. Data on adverse reactions, remissions, and treatment failure \nwere also collected.\nRESULTS: One hundred two patients (73%) had significant improvement after\nstarting SSZ. Fifty-six patients (40%) were able to stop all other medication at \nan average of 9.5 mo. Thirty-nine patients (28%) remitted and discontinued all\nmedication. Twenty-three patients (17%) discontinued the drug for adverse\nreactions. All reactions resolved completely when the drug was discontinued.\nCONCLUSION: SSZ is safe and appears to be an effective primary or second line\ntherapy for JRA, and should be studied further in a multi-institutional, placebo \ncontrolled study.\n\nPMID: 8882047  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

All patients had\nfailed at least one second-line agent and were randomized to receive SSZ (2g/day)\nand pulses of MP (5 mg/kg), or SSZ+ (2 g/day) and pulses of saline (SA). A single\ninfusion of 2 h was carried out in both groups for a total of three times (0, 1\nand 2 months). The two groups were comparable at baseline regarding their\ndemographic and clinical characteristics. Disease activity was evaluated every 2 \nmonths by means of: (1) joint count; (2) morning stiffness; (3) grip strength;\n(4) visual analogue pain score; (5) health assessment questionnaire; and (6)\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate. All outcome measures improved significantly in\nboth groups (P < 0.001). Evaluation at each follow-up visit showed no significant\ndifferences between the groups in any of the adverse effects attributable to SSZ \ntherapy (one SA vs two MP). Adverse effects attributable to SA/MP therapy were\nrare and mild. We concluded that repeated pulses of MP during the first 3 months \nof treatment did not improve the efficacy of SSZ. Therefore, there is no\njustification for using MP in this way during the induction phase of SSZ therapy.\n\nPMID: 8612028  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Strategies for combining SLAs are to begin with\ncombinations, or to add one or more agents to another. The strategy of adding one\nagent to another is illustrated by a study of 40 patients having insufficient\neffect from sulphasalazine (SASP). Patients were randomized between methotrexate \n(MTX) and the combination of SASP and MTX. The patients were evaluated by a\nsingle observer in an open design. The follow-up was 24 weeks. The mean decrease \nin disease activity score was significantly greater and occurred earlier in the\ncombination group. This favourable response was also present in the other\nefficacy variables. The incidence of toxicity was equal in both groups. These\nresults support the strategy of adding MTX to SASP when combining these second\nline antirheumatic drugs.\n\nPMID: 8535640  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

To assess the impact of these therapies on the\ncytokine cascade, the in vitro production and circulating concentrations of\nseveral cytokines and endogenous cytokine antagonists were measured in 30 healthy\ncontrols and longitudinally in a subset of 26 patients enrolled in this study.\nCompared to controls, RA patients had significantly higher circulating\nconcentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble receptors for tumour necrosis\nfactor (sTNFR), soluble receptors for interleukin-2 (sIL-2R) and interleukin-1\nreceptor antagonists (IL-1RA), and their peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMNC) showed a higher spontaneous production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta),\ntumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and IL-1RA (both secreted and\ncell-associated) and a higher stimulated production of cell-associated TNF alpha,\nIL-1RA and (to a lesser extent) IL-1 beta. Treatment with MTX alone (n = 12) or\ncombined with SASP (n = 14), resulted in significant reductions of circulating\nIL-6 and sIL-2R but did not alter IL-1 beta, TNF alpha or IL-1RA concentrations. \nDecreases in circulating levels of sTNFR and in the in vitro production of\ncell-associated IL-1 beta and IL-1RA after stimulation were only observed in\npatients treated with MTX + SASP. The concentrations of IL-1RA and sTNFR in the\ncirculation exceeded moderately those of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha but this is\nprobably insufficient to block IL-1 and TNF alpha activity. In conclusion,\ntherapy with MTX alone or with SASP modulates IL-6 and sIL-2R concentrations in\nRA. Decreased production of IL-1 beta and IL-1RA and circulating sTNFR levels\nwere only observed during therapy with MTX + SASP. Whether this relates to the\nbetter clinical effect observed with the combination therapy remains to be\ninvestigated. Circulating levels of IL-6, sIL-2R and sTNFR seem useful markers of\ndisease activity in RA.\n\nPMID: 7551660  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sixty-seven patients with active disease completed a 24-week,\nopen, randomized study of methotrexate (MTX) versus sulphasalazine (SSZ) or\nhydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Serum sIL-2R levels were evaluated before entry and\nafter 24 weeks by ELISA. Serum sIL-2R were significantly higher in RA patients\nthan in controls (P = 0.0001) and correlated significantly only with erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate (P = 0.03) and with Chronic Arthritis Systemic Index (P =\n0.01) at study entry. No correlation was found between serum sIL-2R and other\nlaboratory and clinical indices of disease activity. After 24 weeks of treatment \nno differences in serum sIL-2R in comparison with basal levels were found in\neither responding or in non-responding patients, although the mean reduction of\nsIL-2R was more marked in the MTX-treated cohort than in the HCQ and SSZ-treated \ngroups. These data suggest that in RA the measurement of sIL-2R should be used\nwith caution as an isolated index of disease activity and that it is not a useful\nmarker of response to treatment with second line drugs.\n\nPMID: 7586985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\ntreatment was initiated with 1/4 of this dose and increased by weekly increments \nof 250-500 mg until the total dose was reached. In all patients sulphasalazine\nwas the first disease-modifying agent tried. Among nine of the ten patients there\nwas significant improvement in all clinical scores, including the number of\nactive joints and the severity grading (tenderness and limitation of motion).\nWithin 3 months of sulphasalazine therapy the laboratory measurements revealed\nmarked improvement in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and haemoglobin\nvalues.

A 48-week double-blind, prospective,\nplacebo-controlled study.\n\nHannonen P(1), M\xc3\xb6tt\xc3\xb6nen T, Hakola M, Oka M.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Medicine, Central Hospital, Jyv\xc3\xa4skyl\xc3\xa4, Finland.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine (SSZ) in\nthe treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMETHODS: Eighty patients (symptomatic disease < 12 months) were randomly assigned\nto treatment with SSZ or placebo for 48 weeks. Clinical, laboratory, and\nscintigraphic data were used to determine the effects of treatment.\nRESULTS: SSZ was superior to placebo in reducing the laboratory features of\ninflammation, the clinical parameters of disease activity, as well as the\nscintigraphic activity in the joints. Furthermore, fewer erosive changes\ndeveloped in the joints of patients receiving active treatment, but the\ndifference between treatment groups did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSION: SSZ is effective in the treatment of RA, and its onset of action is\nrapid. The results support the view that SSZ retards the development of joint\nerosions. However, like other conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs,\nits remission-inducing ability is insufficient.\n\nPMID: 7902092  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Both before and after the drug trial,\nhelplessness indices accounted for a highly significant amount of variation in\nself-reported pain and functional disability. Moreover, Time 1 helplessness\npredicted greater flare activity after the drug trial. Helplessness indices,\nhowever, did not correlate with joint examination measures within time periods,\nnor did they predict change in these measures over the drug trial. The importance\nof the role of helplessness in subjective and objective measures of clinical\nstatus in persons undergoing drug therapy is discussed.\n\nPMID: 8103802  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Twenty-three patients (17\nboys and 6 girls) with juvenile spondyloarthropathy inadequately controlled by\nnonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy were given sulfasalazine in an average\ndosage of 39 mg/kg/d. After 3 months, 20 patients exhibited marked clinical\nimprovement; of these 20, 14 discontinued or reduced their nonsteroidal\nantiinflammatory drug. Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate fell significantly\nfrom 36.8 to 13.7 mm/h. After 12 months. 78% of the patients were in remission.\nSulfasalazine was stopped in five patients of which none had evidence of disease \nrelapse 6 to 12 months later. Side effects were infrequent: 2 patients had a skin\nrash requiring drug withdrawal and two developed mild neutropenia. These data\nsuggest that sulfasalazine is an effective and safe second-line drug for the\nmanagement of severe juvenile spondyloarthropathies.\n\nPMID: 7908584  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sulphasalazine has\nbeen shown to have disease modifying properties and to inhibit the production of \ncytokines in vitro. To evaluate the effect of sulphasalazine on cytokine\nproduction in vivo, serum cytokine levels were measured in a group of patients\nwith RA entered into a randomised controlled trial. Serum levels of IL-1 alpha,\nIL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha were measured at baseline and at two monthly\nintervals for six months in 17 patients receiving sulphasalazine and in 22\npatients treated with placebo. The two groups of patients had a similar age and\nsex distribution, had had RA for less than a year, had no joint erosions, and had\nnot been treated previously with any other disease modifying drugs. In the 39\npatients studied IL-1 alpha was detected (> 0.1 ng/ml) at baseline in 14 patients\n(median 0.24 ng/ml), IL-1 beta in 25 patients (median 1.0 ng/ml), TNF alpha in 27\npatients (median 1.2 ng/ml), and IL-6 in 33 patients (median 0.44 ng/ml). In the \ngroup treated with sulphasalazine there was a progressive and significant decline\nin serum IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha levels over the six month period\n(median levels at six months were < 0.1, 0.12, and 0.44 ng/ml respectively).\nInterleukin 6 levels were significantly reduced only at the four month time point\n(median level of 0.23 ng/ml). These reductions were associated with improvements \nin clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity. In contrast patients\nreceiving the placebo showed no changes in serum cytokine levels and no\nimprovement in clinical and laboratory indices of disease activity. These results\nsuggest that sulphasalazine may exert its disease modifying effect partly by\nsuppressing cytokine production in vivo.\n\nPMCID: PMC1004800\nPMID: 1358037  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The two drugs improved many parameters of disease \nactivity at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. At 12 weeks, the group treated with\nsulphasalazine had a lower platelet count (Mann-Whitney U test), erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate, and articular index, with a greater decrease in erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate (Students t test) and C reactive protein between 0 and 12\nweeks. There were no significant differences between sulphasalazine and auranofin\ntreatment after 24 and 48 weeks.

Clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity were monitored\ninitially and thereafter at 2-week intervals for the first 2 months, and then at \n4-week intervals until the end of the 24-week study. There was significant\nclinical improvement at the end, as shown by scores for joint pain (Ritchie),\ngrip strength and morning stiffness (p less than 0.0001, less than 0.0001 and\nless than 0.01, respectively, by paired t test). Clinical improvement was\naccompanied by significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and\nincrease in hemoglobin (p less than 0.002 and less than 0.016, respectively).\nThere was improvement in some cases as early as 3 weeks after starting therapy.\nThe drop-out rate was significant: 19/54 (35%), most (13) due to side-effects,\nmainly gastrointestinal; none of the side-effects were serious. Our results,\nsimilar to those of other studies, indicate that despite the high rate of side\neffects, SLZ is an effective, second-line drug for RA.\n\nPMID: 1682225  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Results of two metaanalyses.\n\nFelson DT(1), Anderson JJ, Meenan RF.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Boston University Arthritis Center, Massachusetts.\n\nComment in\n    Arthritis Rheum. 1991 Oct;34(10):1342-3.\n\nWe performed 2 metaanalyses of placebo-controlled and comparative clinical trials\nto examine the relative efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), injectable\ngold, D-penicillamine (DP), sulfasalazine (SSZ), auranofin (AUR), and\nantimalarial drugs, the second-line drugs most commonly used to treat rheumatoid \narthritis (RA). For the efficacy study, we applied a set of inclusion criteria\nand focused on trials which provided information on tender joint count,\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate, or grip strength. We found 66 clinical trials\nthat contained 117 treatment groups of interest, and for each drug, we combined\nthe treatment groups. For each outcome, results showed that AUR tended to be\nweaker than other second-line drugs. The results of the 3 outcome measures were\nsynthesized into a composite measure of outcomes, and AUR was significantly\nweaker than MTX (P = 0.006), injectable gold (P less than 0.0001), DP (P less\nthan 0.0001), and SSZ (P = 0.009) and was slightly, but not significantly, weaker\nthan antimalarial agents (P = 0.11). We also found heterogeneity among\nantimalarial agents, in that patients treated with chloroquine did better than\nthose treated with hydroxychloroquine. We found little difference in efficacy\nbetween MTX, injectable gold, DP, and SSZ. A power analysis showed that a trial\nshould contain at least 170 patients per treatment group to successfully\ndifferentiate between more effective and less effective (e.g., AUR) second-line\ndrugs. None of the reported interdrug comparative trials we reviewed were this\nlarge. For the toxicity study, our inclusion criteria captured RA trials which\nreported the proportion of patients who discontinued therapy because of drug\ntoxicity and the total proportion who dropped out. We found 71 clinical trials\nthat contained 129 treatment groups. The average proportion who dropped out and\nthe average proportion who dropped out because of drug toxicity were computed for\neach drug. Overall, 30.2% of the patients in these trials dropped out; 50% of\nthem did so because of drug toxicity. Injectable gold had higher toxicity rates\n(P less than 0.05) and higher total dropout rates (P less than 0.01) than any\nother drug; 30% of gold-treated patients dropped out because of side effects\nversus 15% of all trial patients. Antimalarial drugs and AUR had relatively low\nrates of toxicity; the rate for MTX was imprecise because of discrepancies\nbetween trials. Thus, of the commonly used second-line drugs, AUR is the weakest,\nand injectable gold is the most toxic. Agents introduced in the future will be\ncompared with these drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 1977391  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The degree and extent of change in, and the usefulness of, \nvarious parameters of disease activity were also evaluated. Two hundred patients \nwith active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to either sulphasalazine\nor penicillamine and monitored for a minimum of two years. Fifty-one percent of\nthe 102 patients who received sulphasalazine continued treatment for two years,\ncompared with 40 per cent of the 98 patients allocated to penicillamine. The\nproportion of patients stopping therapy because of adverse reactions or due to\nlack or loss of effect was similar in the two groups. There was no difference\nbetween the two groups in the extent of improvement in clinical and laboratory\nvariables at one and two years. The majority of patients showed improvement in\nmost measured parameters; very few showed global improvement. The degree of\nimprovement varied with the parameter assessed, being greatest in relatively\neasily measured variables such as duration of morning stiffness and ESR, and\nleast for functional index. The effect and toxicity of these two agents in this\nsetting was as anticipated. No clinically relevant difference could be\ndemonstrated between the two drugs.\n\nPMID: 1974723  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Decisive\nimprovement was observed in both treatment groups over a 1 year period.

A trend toward greater radiological deterioration was observed \nin patients receiving sulphasalazine, but this was not statistically significant.\nOnly 11 of the 38 patients who completed 1 year of therapy were continuing to\ntake the same drug 5 years later. Eight patients were continuing D-penicillamine \nand three were still taking sulphasalazine. Among the patients who completed 1\nyear of therapy, treatment was subsequently terminated because of loss of\neffective disease control in a significantly higher proportion of patients\nreceiving sulphasalazine (P less than 0.01).

The efficacy\ncriteria which were selected (decrease of the sed rate by more than 50 p. cent\nduring the first hour, morning stiffness under 20 minutes, Ritchie's index\ninferior to 10 and decreased cortisone and NSAID doses), explain that 25 p. cent \nof the patients are considered as satisfied after 12 months of trial. The\npatients selected, present severe forms of the disease or forms resistant to\nother treatments. The improvement appears significant after the first month. Half\nof the patients left the trial either because of ineffectiveness, or evolutive\nrelapse (21.73 p. cent) or because of side-effects (28.26 p. cent). The most\nfrequently observed disorders and intolerances are of digestive nature. No\nserious accident is to be deplored. Such results are in accordance with the data \nfrom the literature. The SASP must therefore be considered as the fundamental\ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The new galenic forms, dissolving in the\ngastro-intestinal tract, have enabled to markedly improve the digestive\ntolerance.\n\nPMID: 2903546  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

GST is known to\nbe superior to PBO, and the response of the GST-treated group was similar to that\nseen in other trials. The response of the PBO group, however, was much greater\nthan in other placebo groups we have studied. SSZ was similar in efficacy to\ninjectable gold, but was better tolerated. Because of adverse drug reactions\n(most commonly, rash, stomatitis, and proteinuria), 41% of patients were\nwithdrawn from the GST treatment.

Hand radiograph scores deteriorated significantly\nover this period, but in a group of 31 patients in whom one year films were also \navailable this deterioration was limited to the first year. This slowing of\nradiological deterioration was not related to 'normalisation' of the erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate (ESR). Compared with a 'control' group of 10 patients who had \nrefused offers of second line therapy, sulphasalazine treated patients showed\nless deterioration over the two year period, and this difference was more marked \nthan in previous studies of gold or penicillamine. No significant change was seen\nin large joint radiographs in sulphasalazine treated patients over two years, but\nthis probably represents the poor sensitivity of the method of assessment. No\nsignificant correlation was seen between changes in inflammatory indices and\nslowing of radiological deterioration in erosion score. Thus sulphasalazine\nappears to slow the progression of radiological disease of the hands over the\nsecond year of treatment in a representative sample of patients who continue to\nreceive treatment for two years.\n\nPMCID: PMC1002149\nPMID: 2884932  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Early treatment\neffect and better tolerance suggest the use of SASP especially for early\ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Positive\nresults of two placebo-controlled studies in ankylosing spondylitis for the first\ntime open the perspective of a long-acting antiphlogistic therapy in this\ndisease.

It is well-tolerated in the long-term with comparatively few\nserious side effects. Its mechanism of action, however, is still not entirely\nclear. We have found that the sulphapyridine moiety penetrates the synovial\nmembrane and also that it can modify immune function. While Salazopyrin\nundoubtedly has an important role in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, it\nprobably also has a place in the treatment of seronegative arthropathies and the \nspondyloarthritides. Furthermore we suggest that it should be used as an anchor\ndrug in combination therapy to attempt to suppress disease activity further and\nlimit joint damage.\n\nPMID: 2893451  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Serum and urine samples were\ncollected at regular intervals over a 96 hour period for estimation of\nconcentrations of sulphasalazine, sulphapyridine and its metabolites. This\nprocedure was repeated after 17 days of continuous treatment with salazopyrin-EN \n2 g daily in order to compare the drug's kinetics at 'steady-state'. Whilst the\ninterindividual variation in kinetic parameters was large, age and acetylator\nstatus had a significant influence on a number of factors. The elimination\nhalf-life of sulphasalazine was prolonged in the elderly whilst renal clearance\nwas increased in slow acetylators at 'steady-state'. The tmax and apparent volume\nof distribution of sulphapyridine were increased in the elderly after a single\ndrug dosage but these differences disappeared with regular dosing. The Cmax,\nelimination half-life, 'steady-state' serum concentration, apparent volume of\ndistribution and total clearance of sulphapyridine were all affected by\nacetylator status. We conclude that old age has only a minor effect on the body's\nhandling of sulphasalazine and sulphapyridine but that acetylator phenotype plays\na significant role in determining the 'steady-state' serum concentrations of\nsulphapyridine. This is likely to have practical implications with regard to some\nof the drug's adverse effects.\n\nPMID: 2893450  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There are a number of established methods that give\nreproducible scores which relate to increasing joint damage by measuring erosions\nand loss of joint space. Only 3 placebo-controlled trials have shown convincing\nevidence that gold or cyclophosphamide reduce the rate of progression of joint\ndamage. Most placebo-controlled studies have failed to show a beneficial effect\nof slow acting antirheumatic drugs on radiological joint damage progression.\nHowever, comparative studies or analyses of cohorts of patients taking slow\nacting antirheumatic drugs show comparable amounts of progression for patients\nreceiving gold and other drugs in this category. In addition, patients who show a\nclinical response also have less radiological progression after 6 months'\ntherapy. In these circumstances, sulphasalazine produces comparable rates of\nradiological progression to those produced by gold and penicillamine. There are\nmany problems associated with the use of radiological assessments to determine\nthe progression of rheumatoid arthritis; thus, this method should not be deemed\nthe most important technique by which to measure the success of therapy.\n\nPMID: 2877856  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Drugs. 1986;32 Suppl 1:18-26.\n\nPharmacological and biochemical actions of sulphasalazine.\n\nHoult JR.\n\nThis review considers recent pharmacological and biochemical studies of\nsulphasalazine and its colonic metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid and\nsulphapyridine, in relation to the use of the parent drug for the treatment of\nulcerative colitis and, more recently, rheumatoid arthritis. Several factors make\nit difficult to analyse the mode of action of sulphasalazine, such as the\naetiology and variable course of the conditions it is used to treat, lack of\nsuitable animal models, and the question of which moiety of the drug is active.\nAn important feature of the pharmacokinetics of the drug after oral\nadministration is the significance of the azo cleavage of sulphasalazine due to\nbacterial action. The effects of sulphasalazine on the metabolism of arachidonic \nacid to prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been widely studied because of the\nevidence that these substances are formed in increased amounts in inflammatory\nbowel diseases. The effects are complex, but it appears that sulphasalazine and\n5-aminosalicylic acid are weak and very weak inhibitors, respectively, of both\ncyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-dependent pathways. The overall pharmacological\nprofile may favour a more marked inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway because\nof the additional ability of 5-aminosalicylic acid to enhance prostanoid\nproduction and of sulphasalazine to inhibit prostaglandin inactivation. Drugs\nwith selective lipoxygenase inhibitory actions in the colon should thus be sought\nso as not to compromise the prostaglandin pathway. Other properties of\nsulphasalazine, including its immunosuppressive, antifolate, lymphocyte\ninhibitory and leucocyte modulatory actions, are also discussed in the context of\nthe therapeutic uses of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPMID: 2877850  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

To test these potential roles for\nPMP 45 patients with active RA were randomly allocated to treatment with PMP\nalone, PMP + sulphasalazine (SAS - at a maintenance dose of 2.0 g/day), or PMP + \nD-penicillamine (DPA - at a maintenance dose of 500 mg/day). In each case three 1\ng intravenous infusions were given on alternate days during the first week of the\ntrial. Patients were monitored for 24 weeks by standard clinical and laboratory\nmeasurements. All three treatment groups showed significant clinical and\nlaboratory improvements at two weeks. With PMP + DPA and PMP + SAS these\nimprovements were sustained and were not significantly different in these two\ntreatment groups. However, in the 'PMP only' group ESR and CRP rose to\npretreatment values by eight weeks. Twelve patients withdrew from the study owing\nto a relapse of the RA. No serious adverse effects were seen in the 'PMP only'\ngroup. Both combination regimens were well tolerated; adverse effects seen were\nattributable to either DPA or SAS. We conclude that PMP alone is insufficient for\ntreatment of RA but can be used successfully in combination with either DPA or\nSAS. A comparison between these results obtained from two previous groups of 15\npatients treated with DPA alone and SAS alone (using the same study design) shows\nthat PMP accelerated the response to therapy by at least six weeks.\n\nPMCID: PMC1001764\nPMID: 2865930  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Over 24 weeks sulphapyridine showed a\npronounced second line effect comparable with sulphasalazine and with a similar\ntoxicity profile, whereas 5-aminosalicylic acid showed only a weak first line\neffect. Thus sulphapyridine appears to be the active moiety responsible for the\nsecond line effect of sulphasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis.

The major obstacle\nwhich prevents collection of the necessary data is the lack of a suitable control\ngroup. In this report experience with three 'second-line placebo groups' is\ndescribed, and previous studies in the literature which incorporated a placebo\ngroup are reviewed. In the absence of concurrent corticosteroid therapy very few \npatients remain on placebo second-line medication after one year. Those that do, \nappear to have milder disease and are not representative of the group as a whole.\nData on outcome measures need to be collected over two to five years, but the\nanswer to the question which is posed does not depend upon larger and larger\nplacebo groups which constitute increasing bias.

In rheumatoid arthritis\n(RA), however, serum and red cell folate concentrations are often low and\nsulphasalazine might stress folate metabolism. In a prospective study, 2 g\nsulphasalazine was compared with 500 mg penicillamine daily in 30 patients over\n24 weeks. Pre-treatment serum and red cell folate concentrations were low-normal.\nImprovements in disease activity and haemoglobin occurred in both treatment\ngroups, but MCV increased only in patients taking sulphasalazine. Serum and red\ncell folate concentrations did not change in either group. Increased MCV with\nsulphasalazine might therefore reflect reticulocytosis secondary to drug-induced \nhaemolysis. The mechanisms by which sulphasalazine antagonizes folate metabolism \nare dose-dependent and, consequently, higher doses might precipitate folate\ndeficiency.\n\nPMID: 2864741  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After the\npublication of an unfavourable trial, however, the drug was restricted to\npatients with ulcerative colitis. In the late 1970s sulphasalazine was\nre-examined in rheumatoid arthritis and favourable results reported in "open"\ntrials. A double blind controlled trial was therefore conducted comparing enteric\ncoated sulphasalazine and D-penicillamine in patients with active rheumatoid\narthritis. A total of 63 patients were recruited in two centres; 31 were treated \nwith sulphasalazine and 32 received penicillamine. After 16 weeks\' treatment both\ndrugs had produced significant improvements in clinical score, pain score\nmeasured on a visual analogue scale, grip strength, Ritchie articular index,\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum C reactive protein concentration.\nNausea was the major side effect in the sulphasalazine treated group. No\npotentially dangerous effects of sulphasalazine were encountered in contrast with\nthose seen in the penicillamine group. The results suggest that sulphasalazine is\nan effective and safe drug capable of producing remissions in active rheumatoid\narthritis. They also lend confidence to the use of preliminary "open" trials as a\nmeans of screening for remission inducing drugs in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPMCID: PMC1549360\nPMID: 6138116  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

CVPP (CCNU, vinblastine, procarbazine, prednisone)\nwas compared to a new combination, BAVS (bleomycin, Adriamycin, vincristine,\nstreptozotocin), and to a third regimen consisting of alternating cycles of CVPP \nand BAVS. At the current analysis there is no significant difference in complete \nresponses among the chemotherapy regimens. MER did not improve complete response \nfrequency and was associated with significantly poorer survival for patients\npreviously treated with chemotherapy. There was also no benefit with MER for\npatients with at least one pretreatment positive skin test. Because of the\ndocumented lack of therapeutic benefit and the morbidity of painful ulcers, MER\ntreatment has been discontinued.\n\nPMID: 7018726  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Twenty-one patients were\ntreated with BCG, and 19 were controls. Eleven patients in each group relapsed\nduring a follow-up period long enough to make it unlikely that further relapses\nwould occur. There were no significant differences in the length of remission or \nthe site of relapse that could be attributed to treatment. Eleven patients died: \nof these none of the six patients in the BCG group but all of the five in the\ncontrol group had stage D lymphomas. BCG treatment increased the rate of recovery\nfrom tumour-induced immunosuppression, but within the BCG group immunocompetence \nimproved most rapidly in the patients who relapsed-a finding that appears to\ncontradict the tenet retionalising the use of immunological adjuvants as\ntreatment.\n\nPMCID: PMC1639074\nPMID: 766905  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

QRB7 is the proprietary oak bark extract in Bensal HP.\nIt is indicated as an external treatment for the inflammation and irritation\nassociated with many common forms of dermatitis, including certain eczematoid\nconditions. These conditions include complications associated with pyodermas, and\nin the treatment of insect bites, burns, and fungal infections.\nOBJECTIVE: To quantitatively measure the difference in diabetic ulcer size\nreduction when using Bensal HP versus silver sulfadiazine cream (SSC) for topical\ntreatment as an adjunct to conventional treatment.\nSETTING: Private office of the primary author.\nMETHODS: Forty diabetic patients with noncellulitic plantar Wagner grade 1 or 2\nulcers and a minimal ankle brachial index of 0.75 were randomly assigned to\neither the Bensal HP (QRB7) treatment group or SSC control group for 6 weeks of\ntreatment. In addition to either Bensal HP or SSC, all wounds were cultured and\ntreated with debridement at time 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks and with off-loading.\nRESULTS: The combined wound diameter of the Bensal HP group decreased 72.5%\ncompared to 54.7% for the SSC group. There was a statistical significance between\nthe decreases in wound sizes after 6 weeks of treatment (P = .016). The Cohen\neffect size for the Bensal HP group was 2.06 compared with 1.03 for the SSC\ngroup.\nCONCLUSION: In this tightly controlled 6-week study in which no patients were\nlost to follow-up, Bensal HP seems to be an effective treatment for properly\ntreated diabetic ulcers, outperforming an identical control group whose only\ndifference was SSC as a medication.\n\nPMID: 18836324  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Amounts of salicylates in\nfoods are thus of interest, but data are scarce and controversial. We gave 58\nmumol (10.5 mg) pure acetylsalicylic acid or 66 mumol (9.1 mg) salicylic acid to \nsix volunteers and recovered 77-80% in 24-h urine samples. Thus, urinary\nexcretion is a valid indicator for intake of free forms of (acetyl)salicylic\nacid. To estimate the bioavailable salicylate contents of diets, we subsequently \nstudied salicylate excretion in 17 volunteers from 14 countries and four\ncontinents who ate a wide variety of self-selected diets. Median 24-h urinary\nsalicylate excretion was 10 mumol (range: 6-12 mumol). Values increased with the \nfiber content of the diet (r = 0.73), suggesting that vegetable foods are the\nmain sources of salicylates. However, amounts of salicylates in a variety of\ndiets are evidently low and probably insufficient to affect disease risk.\n\nPMID: 8901795  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

German Multicenter Study.\n\nMrowietz U(1), F\xc3\xa4rber L, Henneicke-von Zepelin HH, Bachmann H, Welzel D,\nChristophers E.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Dermatology, University of Kiel, Germany.\n\nBACKGROUND: Although cyclosporine has been found to be effective therapy for\nsevere psoriasis, only limited data exist about efficacy and safety during\nlong-term treatment with a low-dose regimen. Furthermore, little is known about\nthe course of psoriasis after drug withdrawal.\nOBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the results of long-term therapy with\ncyclosporine for severe psoriasis with particular regard to efficacy and safety, \nas well as the disease course after stopping treatment.\nMETHODS: A multicenter study of 217 patients treated with 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg\nper day of cyclosporine was performed. Duration of treatment ranged from 6 to 30 \nmonths followed by a posttreatment period of 3 months. Efficacy was assessed by\nthe Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and safety was monitored by clinical and\nlaboratory investigations.\nRESULTS: Patients with severe psoriasis showing a reduction in the Psoriasis Area\nand Severity Index of 75% with their individual dose of cyclosporine maintained\nclinical improvement during continuous maintenance therapy. Newly occurring side \neffects were less frequent during the maintenance phase than in the induction\nphase. After withdrawal of cyclosporine, worsening of psoriasis requiring\nantipsoriatic therapy was seen in about half of the patients.\nCONCLUSION: Cyclosporine is effective for long-term therapy for severe psoriasis \nand does not lead to severe deterioration of the disease after drug withdrawal.\n\nPMID: 7657870  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate the\nbreakdown of bradykinin and therefore enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis mediated\nby bradykinin. Evidence was found of such a prostaglandin E2 mediated\ncontribution to ventricular unloading by enalapril, which was blocked by\nsalicylate. The contribution, however, was small and variable, and salicylate\naddition had on average no significant de-unloading effect during the day.\nUnloading was abolished in only three of the 20 patients in the short term study \nand in one of the 12 in the extended study. At night, when other effects of\nenalapril on blood pressure had waned and the bradykinin induced effect\npersisted, salicylate significantly reduced the remaining small unloading effect.\nNo effect was seen of salicylate addition on reversal of remodelling. Enalapril\nreduced angiotensin II induced synthesis of systemic and renal prostaglandin I2\nand thromboxane A2, initially only during the day, but later also at night. It\nthereby masked suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis by salicylate, which is\nthe effect to which reinfarct prevention by salicylate is attributed.\nCONCLUSION: The risk is low that salicylate will substantially reduce the benefit\nof enalapril in patients with heart failure by de-unloading the ventricle. Like\nother effects induced by bradykinin significant de-unloading occurs in only a\nminority of the patients. In the presence of enalapril, however, salicylate will \nprobably not be as effective as expected in reducing reinfarction risk, because\nenalapril already reduces thromboxane A2 synthesis effectively in patients with\nheart failure and no further reduction by salicylate was found.\n\nPMCID: PMC483803\nPMID: 7727181  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of high dose (100 mg/kg\nper day, n = 30) versus low dose (30 mg/kg per day, n = 30) salicylate. Duration \nof fever, SGPT, serum salicylate, plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and\n6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) levels were compared before enrollment\nand on days 4, 7 and 14 of treatment. In the high dose group, duration of fever\nwas significantly shorter than that of the low dose group (3.2 +/- 0.3 versus 5.4\n+/- 0.8 days, P less than 0.05), however, SGPT levels were significantly elevated\n(157 +/- 34 versus 48 +/- 11 IU/1, P less than 0.05). No differences in the\nincidence of coronary artery lesions were observed (5/30 versus 7/30). Plasma\nTxB2 production was completely blocked in both groups, and plasma 6-keto-PGF1\nalpha levels in the high dose group on day 14 was lower than that in the low dose\ngroup (39 +/- 8 versus 159 +/- 65 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). SGPT and plasma\n6-keto-PGF1 alpha correlated with serum salicylate concentration. These data\nsuggest that high dose salicylate therapy may be disadvantageous as\nanti-thrombotic therapy, and supports the notion that low dose therapy is safe in\nthe acute stage of Kawasaki disease.\n\nPMID: 1915517  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In\nrheumatic patients the action of the drug (10 ml of a 10% solution,\nintravenously) on the rheoencephalographic findings and the total arterial\npressure was investigated. Sodium salicylate was shown to raise the tonicity of\nthe intra- and extracranial vessels, to lower the amplitude of the pulse\nfluctuations and to highten the total arterial pressure. The cerebral circulation\ndepends upon changes in the tonicity of the cerebral vessels and on the total\narterial pressure, i. e. with a significant rise of the latter it increases in\nspite of a greater vascular resistance. Changes in the blood flow are followed by\ncorresponding variations in the PO2 of the brain tissue. No significant changes\nof the pressure in the venous system of the brain could be established.\n\nPMID: 1102330  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Br Poult Sci. 2005 Apr;46(2):137-43.\n\nAntipyretic effect of oral sodium salicylate after an intravenous E. coli LPS\ninjection in broiler chickens.\n\nBaert K(1), Duchateau L, De Boever S, Cherlet M, De Backer P.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacy and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary\nMedicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium. kris.baert@ugent.be\n\nA study was set up to investigate the influence of sodium salicylate on fever and\nacute phase reaction after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in broiler\nchickens. An acute phase reaction was provoked through the intravenous injection \nof Escherichia coli LPS. Four oral doses of sodium salicylate were tested. Apart \nfrom body temperature, other inflammation indices, such as plasma corticosterone \nand ceruloplasmin, serum thromboxane B2 and zinc concentrations were monitored.\nIntravenous LPS induced a fever of about 1 degree C. A dose-dependent attenuation\nof the fever response of the chickens in the salicylate treated groups was\nobserved. LPS-injected chickens also showed elevated plasma corticosterone and\nceruloplasmin, while serum thromboxane and zinc concentrations decreased. Except \nfor thromboxane B2, no linear relationship with increasing salicylate dose could \nbe shown for the other blood variables. These data confirm that sodium salicylate\nis an effective antipyretic agent after injection of LPS in chickens, if used at \nan appropriate dosage. No dose-related change could be found for the other\ninflammation indices.\n\nPMID: 15957432  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Eur J Pediatr. 1991 Jul;150(9):642-6.\n\nSalicylate treatment in Kawasaki disease: high dose or low dose?\n\nAkagi T(1), Kato H, Inoue O, Sato N.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine,\nJapan.\n\nSalicylate is the basic therapy for Kawasaki disease, however its optimal dose is\ncontroversial. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of high dose (100 mg/kg\nper day, n = 30) versus low dose (30 mg/kg per day, n = 30) salicylate. Duration \nof fever, SGPT, serum salicylate, plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and\n6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) levels were compared before enrollment\nand on days 4, 7 and 14 of treatment. In the high dose group, duration of fever\nwas significantly shorter than that of the low dose group (3.2 +/- 0.3 versus 5.4\n+/- 0.8 days, P less than 0.05), however, SGPT levels were significantly elevated\n(157 +/- 34 versus 48 +/- 11 IU/1, P less than 0.05). No differences in the\nincidence of coronary artery lesions were observed (5/30 versus 7/30). Plasma\nTxB2 production was completely blocked in both groups, and plasma 6-keto-PGF1\nalpha levels in the high dose group on day 14 was lower than that in the low dose\ngroup (39 +/- 8 versus 159 +/- 65 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). SGPT and plasma\n6-keto-PGF1 alpha correlated with serum salicylate concentration. These data\nsuggest that high dose salicylate therapy may be disadvantageous as\nanti-thrombotic therapy, and supports the notion that low dose therapy is safe in\nthe acute stage of Kawasaki disease.\n\nPMID: 1915517  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The effect of sodium acetylo-salicylate (2 g per os) on the thermoregulatory\nresponses of 10 male subjects was studied by direct and indirect calorimetry\nduring two tests : heat exposure at 37 degrees C and exercise (50 W) at 25\ndegrees C. Both test were performed twice : with salicylate treatment and with a \nplacebo. 2. During heat exposure at 37 degrees C for 75 min, the rise in tympanic\ntemperature (Tty) and in mean skin temperature Ts, the time course of heat losses\nby radiation (R), convection (C) and evaporation (E), and the metabolic rate (M),\nmeasured by oxygen consumption, were not altered by salicylate treatment. 3.\nDuring exercise, salicylate treatment did not affect the time course of Tty and\nTs, (R + C) and M. However, salicylate treatment decreased the delay for\ntriggering the evaporative response (E) to the thermal load; similarly, the\nincrease in cutaneous blood flow was triggered sooner in subjected receiving\nsalicylate than in controls. 4. In conclusion, these results suggest that, during\nexercise, the thermal controller triggers thermoregulatory responses during\npassive hyperthermia by heat exposure.\n\nPMID: 370367  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S'\n1. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1976 Dec;33(12):1425-8.\n\nHyporesponsivity of chronic schizophrenic patients to dextroamphetamine.\n\nKornetsky C.\n\nAmong the evidence supporting the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia is the\nfinding that both amphetamine and methylphenidate hydrochloride, potent releasers\nof dopamine, can cause exacerbation of symptoms in the acute schizophrenic\npatient. The present report describes three experiments in which the effects of\namphetamine in chronic schizophrenic patients were studied. In one of the\nexperiments, orally administered, daily doses of 20 mg of dextroamphetamine\nsulfate given at 8 PM had little or no effect on the sleep duration of the\nsubjects. In the other two experiments, doses up to 40 mg given orally also had\nlittle or no effect on the performance of the subjects on a variety of behavioral\ntests. There was no evidence of an exacerbation of the disease process in any of \nthe subjects. The most consistent amphetamine effect was a dose-related increase \nin blood pressure. These results indicate that the chronic schizophrenic patient \nmay be hyporesponsive to amphetamine and suggest that if the dopamine hypothesis \nis correct, then it must be modified to take into account these findings in the\nchronic patient.\n\nPMID: 793562  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Five rheumatoid patients with a knee joint effusion participated in the study.\nAn aqueous solution (0.1 to 0.2 ml) containing paracetamol, salicylate,\ndiclofenac and [125I]-albumin was injected into a given joint to yield target\nconcentrations of approximately 20 micrograms ml-1 for diclofenac, salicylate and\nparacetamol and 10(8) counts ml-1 for [125I]-albumin. 2. Paracetamol, salicylate \nand diclofenac were analysed in synovial fluid by h.p.l.c. [125I]-albumin was\nanalysed using gamma counting. 3. The clearances (+/- s.d.) obtained for the\nsolutes were [125I]-albumin (0.0053 +/- 0.0019 l h-1), diclofenac (0.0096 +/-\n0.0061 l h-1), salicylate (0.024 +/- 0.022 l h-1) and paracetamol (0.055 +/-\n0.041 l h-1). The corresponding fractions unbound of these solutes in synovial\nfluid were 0.0, < or = 0.01, 0.34 +/- 0.09 and 0.85 +/- 0.10, respectively. 4.\nDiffusion of unbound solute through the synovium is estimated to account for (+/-\ns.d.) 0.52 +/- 0.08, 0.87 +/- 0.06 and 0.99 +/- 0.01 of the total clearance of\ndiclofenac, salicylate and paracetamol from the joint space, respectively. The\nremaining proportion of clearance is accounted for by efflux of solute bound to\nalbumin. 5. An expression for the ratio of synovial fluid to total plasma\nconcentrations after systemic administration was developed to include both\ndiffusion of unbound solute and albumin flux. Most solutes appear to satisfy the \nconditions in which this expression reduces to the limiting case where the\nunbound concentration of the solute is identical in the synovial fluid and plasma\nunder steady state conditions.\n\nPMCID: PMC1364779\nPMID: 7833225  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It was established that enteral blood loss was\nsignificantly reduced by combined treatment as determined by Cr51 labelled\nerythrocytes in comparison to that after treatment with indomethacin alone.\nTherapeutic effect was maintained in both groups, no significant disparities were\nobserved. Occurrence of subjective complaints was less frequent in the combined\ntreatment group. It was concluded that the combined preparation consisting of\nindomethacin and sodium-salicylate has a favourable effect in rheumatoid\narthritis.\n\nPMID: 389838  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Their diffuse infiltrative nature\nand the relative inaccessibility of the brain to blood and lymph are barriers to \nsurgical and cytotoxic treatments alike. Preclinical animal studies demonstrated \nthat intravenously administered tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes will reject \ntumors growing in the brain. Specifically activated effector T lymphocytes may be\ngenerated by in vivo immunization followed by restimulation of antigen-primed T\ncells with autologous tumor cells in vitro. In order to apply these findings to\nhumans, feasibility studies of combined active immunization and specific adoptive\ncellular immunotherapy were performed on fifteen patients with recurrent\nastrocytoma. The objective was to determine whether; 1) T cells could be grown\nfrom peripheral blood of patients immunized with autologous tumor cells, and 2)\nwhether stimulated cells could be safely readministered to patients. Patients\nwere immunized with a combination of their own irradiated tumor cells and\nBacillus of Calmette and Guerin. Two weeks later a mononuclear cell-rich fraction\nof blood was obtained by leukapheresis. Mononuclear cells were cultured with\nirradiated autologous tumor cells and interleukin-2. Selective expansion of CD4+ \nand CD8+ T lymphocytes occurred. Intravenous transfer of stimulated cells to the \nfifteen patients on twenty-four separate occasions with or without systemic\nadministration of interleukin-2 was tolerated with limited toxicity. The studies \nestablished the feasibility of conducting controlled studies of the anti-tumor\neffects of tumor antigen-specific cellular immunotherapy.\n\nPMID: 8699241  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol. 2008 Nov-Dec;74(6):611-3.\n\nAn uncontrolled, open label study of sulfasalazine in severe alopecia areata.\n\nAghaei S.\n\nAuthor information: \nDepartment of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Jahrom University of Medical\nSciences, Jahrom, Iran. shahinaghaei@yahoo.com\n\nBACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease mediated by T\nlymphocytes. Many treatments have been used but their results remain\ndisappointing. There is a need to propose new therapeutic alternatives.\nMETHODS: During a period of 3 years, 26 patients with recalcitrant or severe AA\n(>40% hair loss) were enrolled in an open-label uncontrolled clinical trial.\nAccording to the response to sulfasalazine, patients were grouped into 3\ncategories: no hair regrowth (< 10% terminal hair), partial hair regrowth\n(10%-90% terminal hair), and complete hair regrowth (90%-100% terminal hair).\nEfficacy evaluation was performed with clinical examination.\nRESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the treatment. Overall, 68.2% (15 of 22\npatients) responded to therapy: 27.3% (6 of 22 patients) achieved complete hair\nregrowth, and 40.9% had partial hair regrowth. Seven (31.8%) patients had no hair\nregrowth. Of the 22 patients with complete and partial remission, 10 (45.5%)\nsuffered a partial or complete relapse. Side effects following treatment were\nseen in 7 (31.8%) patients.\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine could be considered as a therapeutic alternative in the\ntreatment of AA, because of its safety profile, cosmetically acceptable efficacy,\nand good tolerability.\n\nPMID: 19171984  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sulfasalazine has\nbeen reported to show success in the treatment of persistent cases of alopecia\nareata. Objective To assess the efficacy of sulfasalazine in cases of\nrecalcitrant alopecia areata that do not respond to topical and intralesional\ncorticosteroids, 5% minoxidil, or psoralen plus ultraviolet-A (PUVA) therapy.\nMETHODS: Thirty-nine patients with persistent alopecia areata received 3 g of\noral sulfasalazine for 6 months, and terminal hair regrowth was quantified as no \nresponse, moderate response, or good response.\nRESULTS: A good response occurred in 10 of the 39 patients (25.6%), a moderate\nresponse in 12 (30.7%), and a poor or no response in 17 (43.5%).\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine can be used as an alternative drug in patients with\npersistent alopecia areata.\n\nPMID: 18717871  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The exclusive expression of E7, a\nviral oncogene, in infected cells makes this protein an ideal target for\nimmunotherapy. We recently reported on the results of a trial in women with\ncervical carcinoma-in-situ using HspE7, a protein vaccine consisting of full\nlength HPV16 E7 linked to a heat shock protein from M. bovis. The stimulating\neffects of HspE7 on specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been demonstrated in\nvitro and in (pre-)clinical trials. The induction of a B-cell response by HspE7\nand its association with clinical outcome is unknown, and is the purpose of this \nstudy.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We measured the serum IgG levels against HPV16 E7 and HPV16 \nand -18 VLPs using a multiplexed Luminex based assay in 57 women with CIS who\nreceived the HspE7 vaccine.\nRESULTS: Vaccination with HspE7 results in a modest, yet maintained increase in\nHPV16 E7 specific IgG levels. While not significant, increased HPV16 E7 IgG\nlevels appear to be correlated with a positive therapeutic effect. Women who were\npreviously treated for recurrent disease (by LEEP) had significantly higher HPV16\nE7 IgG levels compared with subjects without recurrent disease (p=0.01). In women\nwith recurrent disease, higher IgG levels correlated with complete pathological\nresponse.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that IgG levels could potentially be used as a\nmarker for response to a therapeutic vaccine. Further translational\ninvestigations of the 'priming' of local immune responses using extirpative\nprocedures should be explored.\n\nCopyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the\nlong-term impact of cyclophosphamide on patients with a history of superficial\nbladder cancer. Between July 1986 and January 1988, 58 consecutive patients with \nprimary superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were included in\nthis study. All patients had a transurethral R0 resection. Then 6 weekly\nintravesical instillations of 120 mg bacillus Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) were\nperformed. Until June 1987, 22 consecutive patients (group A) received an\nadditional intravenous application of 700 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide prior to the\nBCG immunotherapy, while from July 1987 36 patients were treated without\ncyclophosphamide. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and\ncomparison of survival using the log rank test. Tumor staging, grading, and size \nwere equally distributed in both groups. No significant difference could be\nobserved regarding the 10-year overall survival rate (group A: 59%, group B:\n58%), the 10-year tumor-specific survival rate (89 vs 94%), and the 10-year\nprogression-free survival rate (85 vs 97%). There was a statistically significant\ndeterioration of the 10-year recurrence-free survival rate in the\ncyclophosphamide group (44 vs 70%, log rank test: p < 0.05). Whereas there were\nno recurrences in the upper urinary tract among the patients of group B, 2 of the\n22 patients from group A developed cancer of the renal pelvis. In patients with a\nhistory of superficial bladder cancer, a single dose of cyclophosphamide poses a \nsignificantly increased risk of tumor recurrence in the lower and in the upper\nurinary tract as well.\n\nPMID: 16034647  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Gastric Cancer. 2004;7(4):240-5.\n\nEfficiency of adjuvant immunochemotherapy following curative resection in\npatients with locally advanced gastric cancer.\n\nPopiela T(1), Kulig J, Czupryna A, Szczepanik AM, Zembala M.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)First Department of Surgery and Gastrointestinal Surgery, Jagiellonian University\nMedical College, Cracow, Poland.\n\nBACKGROUND: Despite curative resection, 50%-90% of gastric cancer patients die of\ndisease relapse. Although some clinical trials have indicated that chemotherapy\nand immunochemotherapy may be effective modalities, more recent studies have not \nbeen able to define the standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. The\npresent study evaluated the effect of adjuvant immunochemotherapy with the use of\nBCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and FAM (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, mitomycin C)\nchemotherapy on the survival of patients with locally advanced resectable gastric\ncancer.\nMETHODS: A total of 156 patients with stage III or IV gastric cancer who had\nundergone curative resection were randomly assigned to three treatment groups:\nBCG + FAM (immunochemotherapy), FAM (chemotherapy), and control (surgery only).\nTreatment was continued for 2 years or until death. Further postsurgical follow\nup was carried on for up to 10 years.\nRESULTS: Overall 10-year survival was 47.1% for the immunochemotherapy group (P <\n0.037 vs FAM and P < 0.0006 vs control), 30% for the chemotherapy group (vs\ncontrol, NS), and 15.2% for the control group. In patients with pT2/T3 primary\ntumors, 10-year survival was 55.3% for BCG + FAM vs 28.2% for FAM (P < 0.01) and \n14.6% for the control group (P < 0.00018). BCG + FAM significantly improved the\nsurvival of patients with intestinal-type but not diffuse-type cancer.\nImmunochemotherapy was well tolerated.\nCONCLUSION: This study, based on a limited number of patients, indicates that\nadjuvant immunochemotherapy (BCG + FAM) may prolong the survival of gastric\ncancer patients after curative gastrectomy; in particular, in patients with\npT2/T3 tumors and intestinal-type primary tumors. There was no survival benefit\nfrom FAM adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nPMID: 15616772  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We now provide a 10-year update of this trial.\nMETHODS: Between November 11, 1977, and February 28, 1983, 1166 patients with\nresected Dukes' stage B and C adenocarcinoma of the colon were stratified by\nDukes' stage, sex, and age (<65 years or > or =65 years) and then randomly\nassigned to receive no further treatment (surgery alone; 394 patients), adjuvant \nchemotherapy (379 patients), or adjuvant immunotherapy (393 patients). Those\neligible for follow-up included 375 (95.2%) patients in the surgery-alone group, \n349 (92.1%) patients in the adjuvant-chemotherapy group, and 372 (94.7%) patients\nin the adjuvant-immunotherapy group. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS: No difference was observed between patients in the chemotherapy group\nand those in the surgery-alone group in 10-year disease-free survival (hazard\nratio [HR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94 to 1.39;P =.17) or overall\nsurvival (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.38; P=.27). Immunotherapy did not appear \nto prevent tumor relapse after 10 years (for surgery alone versus immunotherapy, \nrelative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.25; P =.93) but had a beneficial\neffect on 10-year overall survival (for surgery alone versus immunotherapy, RR = \n1.27, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.56; P =.02) that apparently results from a reduction in \ndeaths associated with comorbidities in the immunotherapy group.\nCONCLUSION: The disease-free and overall survival benefit associated with\nchemotherapy in this patient population is of limited duration, disappearing\nafter 10 years.\n\nPMID: 15292384  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Several studies have reported\ndifferent rates of false positive biopsies using 5-aminolevulinic acid induced\nfluorescence. In this study we evaluated the effect of previous intravesical\ntherapy on the false positive biopsy rate.\nMETHODS: Two hours prior to endoscopy 1.5g ALA dissolved in 50ml 1.4% NaHCO(3)\nsolution was instilled intravesically. For fluorescence excitation a blue light\nsource (D-light, Karl Storz) was used. Under white and fluorescence light\nguidance, tumor locations were recorded, cold cup biopsies were taken and tumors \nwere resected. Patients were divided into 3 groups, last intravesical therapy\n(IVT) less than 6 months prior to PDD, last IVT longer than 6 months before PDD\nand no previous IVT.\nRESULTS: In total 917 biopsies were taken in 249 procedures of fluorescent and\nnon-fluorescent areas. White light endoscopy revealed 270 and PDD 378 of in total\n390 tumors, resulting in a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 49% for PDD.\nPathologic evaluation considered 270 fluorescent biopsies as false positive. The \nrate of false positive biopsies was 25.7% in the group No IVT, 30.6% in the group\nPDD-IVT >6 months, whereas in the group "within 6 months after intravesical\ntherapy" the rate was 39.6% (p<0.025). When premalignant lesions such as\ndysplasia II are considered tumor the difference between the groups is even more \nsignificant (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The procedure has a high sensitivity for superficial bladder cancer \nand decreases the number of overlooked lesions. Recent intravesical therapy\nresults in significantly more false positive fluorescent biopsies. Since patient \noutcome might predominantly be determined by the early detection and subsequent\ntreatment of (pre)malignant tissue we suggest that PDD is justified even shortly \nafter intravesical therapy.\n\nPMID: 12814675  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The adoptive transfer of these cells can result in tumor\nregression.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV renal cell cancer (RCC) were\nvaccinated with irradiated autologous tumor cells admixed with Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin\nbacillus. Approximately 7 days later, vaccine-primed lymph nodes (VPLNs) were\nharvested and the lymphoid cells secondarily activated with anti-CD3 monoclonal\nantibody and expanded in interleukin 2 (IL-2). The activated cells were\nsubsequently infused intravenously along with the concomitant administration of\nbolus IL-2 (360,000 U/kg intravenously x 15 doses).\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were entered onto the study, of whom 34 completed\nan initial course of cell therapy consisting of a mean (SEM) number of 4.3 (2.2) \nx 10(10) VPLN cells. Among subjects who received cell therapy, there were nine\nresponses (four complete responses [CRs] and five partial responses [PRs]), for\nan overall response rate of 27%. The durations of the CRs were > 48, 45, > 35,\nand 12 months, and the durations of the PRs were > 63, 48, 15, 12, and 4 months. \nCultured tumor cells were available to assess in vitro cytokine release of VPLN\ncells in 24 subjects. The median cytokine release ratio of interferon gamma\n(IFNgamma) to IL-10 for responders and nonresponders was 992 and 5, respectively,\nwhich was significantly different (P =.047).\nCONCLUSION: The treatment protocol resulted in durable tumor responses in\npatients with advanced RCC. The ratio of IFNgamma and IL-10 cytokines released in\nresponse to tumor by the VPLN cells was a significant correlate with tumor\nresponse.\n\nPMID: 12610189  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We studied whether\nthe alternating combination of these agents could improve the efficacy with\ntolerable side-effects in the treatment of high-risk superficial bladder tumors.\nMETHODS: Forty-one patients with high-risk superficial bladder transitional\ncarcinoma were included in this study. Twenty-one patients were randomized into\nthe BCG group and 20 patients were treated with sequential BCG and epirubicin.\nThe patients were followed for 9-24 months (mean 18 months). Recurrence rates,\nmedian time to the first recurrence, progression rate and complications were\ncompared.\nRESULTS: Fifteen percent of the patients in the BCG and epirubicin group and 19% \nof the patients in the BCG alone group developed tumor recurrence. Tumor\nprogression was observed in 4.7% and 10% in the BCG/epirubicin group and the BCG \nalone group, respectively. Median time to first recurrence was 11 months for the \nBCG/epirubicin group and 16 months for the BCG group (P > 0.05). Three patients\nin the BCG/epirubicin treatment group developed serious side-effects, which\nnecessitated antituberculosis treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Because the efficacy of combination was no better than the standard\ntreatment and the alternating combination seemed to be related to a higher\nincidence of side-effects, this study albeit small, does not recommend\ncombination therapy of BCG and epirubicin in high risk patients with superficial \nbladder cancer.\n\nPMID: 10843451  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Are six weekly\ninstillations necessary?\n\nZlotta AR(1), van Vooren JP, Huygen K, Drowart A, Decock M, Pirson M, Jurion F,\nPalfliet K, Denis O, Simon J, Schulman CC.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Urology, Erasme Hospital, University Clinics of Brussels, Belgium. \nazlotta@ulb.ac.be\n\nOBJECTIVE: For more than 20 years, BCG intravesical therapy schedule has included\n6 weekly instillations. Very few studies have, however, analyzed the rationale of\nthis regimen. We previously demonstrated that intravesical BCG induced an\nincreased peripheral immune response against mycobacterial antigens as compared\nto pretreatment values. In the present work, we have studied the weekly evolution\nof this immune response induced by intravesical BCG instillations.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The evolution of the lymphoproliferative response of\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells against BCG culture filtrate (CF), tuberculin \n(PPD) and BCG extract (EXT) was tested before, every week during the BCG\ninstillations and at 3 and 6 months follow-up in 9 patients with superficial\nbladder cancer treated with 6 weekly BCG instillations. Lymphoproliferation was\nmeasured by means of a tritiated thymidine incorporation test.\nRESULTS: A significant increase in the lymphoproliferative response against PPD, \nCF and EXT was observed in 9, 8 and 7 of the 9 patients, respectively, as\ncompared to pre-BCG values. The maximal lymphoproliferation was achieved after 4 \ninstillations in 4/5 patients initially reactive against mycobacterial antigens\nwhereas 2 of 4 initially nonreactive patients required 6 instillations. At 6\nmonths' follow-up, lymphoproliferation against BCG and the other mycobacterial\nantigens returned to pre-BCG values in all patients. In 3 patients who received\nadditional instillations because of tumor recurrence within 1 year of follow-up, \nthe maximum immune response was observed already after 2 instillations.\nCONCLUSION: In most patients, the maximal peripheral immune response is already\nobserved after 4 weekly instillations. However, patients not previously immunized\nagainst mycobacterial antigens may require 6 weekly instillations to achieve a\nmaximum stimulation level. Our data support the need to further evaluate the role\nof this status before starting BCG instillations. It could be of interest to\nstudy whether 6 BCG instillations are really necessary in patients previously\nimmune against mycobacterial antigens.\n\nPMID: 10765079  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Patients and\nMETHODS: Twenty-six cases of primary CIS were treated with BCG. Mean, median and \nminimum follow-up periods were 47, 56 and 24 months. At 6 months, the patients\nwere evaluated endoscopically and the response was classified as complete,\npartial or failure.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one patients (80.8%) showed complete response to BCG, 3 did so\nafter a second course; 28.5% relapsed or progressed at a mean of 44 months. Five \npatients (19.2%) did not respond initially and all progressed in a period of 6\nmonths. Early response to BCG was the only significant prognostic factor (p <\n0.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: A high- and a low-risk group of bladder CIS can be differentiated\naccording to the response to BCG. CIS of the bladder has a poor prognosis, and\nthe number of patients who developed progressive disease is significantly higher \namong the nonresponders.\n\nPMID: 9643664  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patients received intravesical instillation \nof 40 mg epirubicin immediately after transurethral resection (TUR) of the\nbladder cancer. At 1 week after TUR, 80 mg Tokyo-strain BCG was instilled into\nthe bladder once a week for 6 weeks. Thereafter, the patients were followed by\ncystoscopy and urinary cytology at 3-month intervals until recurrence was\ndetected. Of the 29 patients, 28 had no evidence of disease over a mean follow-up\nperiod of 20 months. The 1 case of recurrence occurred at 3 months after TUR and \nthat patient died of cancer progression. The simple recurrence rate was 3.5%\nafter therapy. According to the person-years method, the number of recurrent\ntumors per 100 patient-months was 0.17. The cumulative nonrecurrence rate\ndetermined for all cases was 96.5% at 30 months. Adverse reactions, including\nurinary frequency, urgency, and miction pain, among others, were observed in 27\npatients (93%). Only 1 patient was withdrawn from the treatment because of severe\nbladder-irritation symptoms due to the BCG instillation.

Side effects of UFT administration were acceptably low.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that long-term UFT administration after\ntransurethral resection is effective in preventing the recurrence of superficial \nbladder cancer.\n\nPMID: 8448746  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Concerns have been expressed about the toxicity related\nto this new therapeutic modality. These phase II trial data led European\nurologists to try to answer some questions related to BCG therapy, such as the\noptimal schedule and dose, the most effective BCG strain and the value of BCG\ncompared with current chemotherapeutic drugs. To date, phase III trials have\nshown that BCG is more effective than thiotepa and doxorubicin in reducing tumour\nrecurrences and progression and that BCG seems to be as effective as mitomycin C.\nToxicity is significantly higher with BCG compared to chemotherapeutic drugs; no \nstrain of BCG seems to be superior in this respect. Further studies are required \nto identify the optimal schedule and dose, as well as the best therapeutic\nefficacy/toxicity ratio.\n\nPMID: 1396947  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

N Engl J Med. 1991 Oct 24;325(17):1205-9.\n\nA randomized trial of intravesical doxorubicin and immunotherapy with bacille\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin for transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder.\n\nLamm DL(1), Blumenstein BA, Crawford ED, Montie JE, Scardino P, Grossman HB,\nStanisic TH, Smith JA Jr, Sullivan J, Sarosdy MF, et al.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)West Virginia University Medical Center, Morgantown.\n\nBACKGROUND: In carcinoma of the bladder, both intravesical chemotherapy and\nimmunotherapy can induce tumor regression and reduce the rate of recurrence, but \nthe relative merits of these two therapies are unclear. We conducted a\nmulti-institutional study to address this question.\nMETHODS: Patients with rapidly recurrent (stage Ta and T1) or in situ\ntransitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder were randomly assigned to receive\neither doxorubicin administered intravesically or bacille Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG)\nadministered both intravesically and percutaneously. The 262 eligible patients\nwere followed for a median of 65 months. Complete responses to treatment of\ncarcinoma in situ were confirmed by biopsy and cytologic analysis of the urine.\nRESULTS: For patients with Ta and T1 tumors without carcinoma in situ, the\nestimated probability of being disease free at five years was 17 percent after\ndoxorubicin, as compared with 37 percent after immunotherapy with BCG (P =\n0.015). The median times to treatment failure (termination of treatment, due to\npersistence, recurrence, or progression of disease) were 10.4 and 22.5 months,\nrespectively. For patients with carcinoma in situ the complete-response\nprobability estimates (i.e., the estimated probability of documented\ndisappearance of disease) were 34 percent for doxorubicin (23 of 67 patients) and\n70 percent for BCG (45 of 64 patients) (P less than 0.001); the median times to\ntreatment failure were 5.1 and 39 months, respectively. The probability of being \ndisease-free at five years survival among the patients with carcinoma in situ was\n18 percent after treatment with doxorubicin and 45 percent after BCG therapy.\nPatients treated with BCG had a higher incidence of toxic systemic effects and a \nlarger number of local irritative symptoms than patients treated with\ndoxorubicin, but few of these adverse reactions were severe.\nCONCLUSIONS: As compared with intravesical doxorubicin, immunotherapy with BCG\nprovides improved protection against the recurrence of superficial bladder\ncancer.\n\nPMID: 1922207  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There were no\ndifferences between BCG-treated and control patients in sex, age, cigarettes\nsmoked per day, pack-years of cigarette smoking, white blood cell count, or\nnumber of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Toxicity of BCG was limited to transient \nmalaise and fever (average peak temperature, 38.7 degrees C). There was no\nsignificant difference in outcome (recurrence or survival) between BCG-treated\nand control groups with Stage I or Stage III tumors; there were too few Stage II \ntumors for separate statistical analysis. Outcome was not affected within or\nbetween the two treatment groups by tuberculin skin test status. Combining both\ntreatment groups, Stage III patients had a worse outcome than did Stage I-II\npatients, non-squamous cell tumor patients (large cell and adenocarcinoma) had\nworse outcomes than did squamous cell tumor patients, and men had a worse outcome\nthan women. We conclude that, although preoperative intratumoral BCG therapy is\nsafe, it does not lengthen disease-free interval or prolong survival in patients \nwith non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPMID: 3530442  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The duration of this favorable response and its\neffect on disease progression are the subject of this report. Between March 1978 \nand July 1981, 47 patients with diffuse, often symptomatic, carcinoma in situ\nwere treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin and followed every 3 to 4\nmonths with cystoendoscopy, biopsy and urine cytology for 3 to 6 years. All\npatients had had prior or concurrent superficial papillary tumors controlled\ninitially by transurethral resection and fulguration 2 to 3 weeks before bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin treatment. Of the 47 patients 23 were entered into a randomized\nstudy, and received intravesical and percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guerin.\nAnother 24 patients with carcinoma in situ were treated with intravesical\nbacillus Calmette-Guerin alone. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (Pasteur strain) was\ngiven intravesically (120 mg. in 50 ml. saline) weekly for 6 weeks. Of the 47\npatients 32 (68 per cent) are free of disease (negative urine cytology,\ncystoendoscopy and biopsy): 15 (65 per cent) after combined bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin for a median duration of 51 months (range 37 to 75 months) and 17\n(71 per cent) after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin alone for a median of\n45 months (range 36 to 53 months). Of the 23 patients in the randomized study 4\n(17 per cent) have required cystectomy for local progression of disease compared \nto 17 of 26 controls (65 per cent) who were randomized to transurethral resection\nand fulguration alone. Cystectomy was performed 3 to 27 months after bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin treatment and in 3 patients tumor was localized to the prostate\ngland (no tumor found within the bladder). These data indicate that intravesical \nbacillus Calmette-Guerin is capable of producing long-term remissions of\ncarcinoma in situ in high risk patients and may prevent or delay progression of\ndisease necessitating cystectomy.\n\nPMID: 3511284  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients selected for \ntreatment had an incomplete resection, positive selected site biopsies and/or\npost-resection positive cytology findings. Complete response required negative\nhistology and cytology findings at cystoscopic followup 4 to 8 weeks after\ncompletion of treatment. Of the patients 20 (71 per cent) demonstrated a complete\nresponse, including all 6 with carcinoma in situ. Results converted to negative\nin 16 of 17 patients with positive urine cytology findings and 4 with positive\nprostatic urethral biopsies. Of the responders 8 had received prior treatment\nwith thiotepa. The treatment regimen of 120 mg. Pasteur strain bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin weekly for 6 weeks was well tolerated. It was necessary to limit \nthe number of treatments to 5 because of local irritative effects in only 3\npatients. No chronic bladder disability has been noted during followup of 3 to 30\nmonths. This experience supports the efficacy of bacillus Calmette-Guerin as a\ncost-effective, well tolerated treatment modality for patients with superficial\ntransitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\n\nPMID: 3511283  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Two induction chemotherapy\nprograms were utilized: (1) cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate,\nfluorouracil; or (2) cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine. Patients\nreceived 4500 rads of radiation therapy to the bulk primary tumor and 3000 rads\nto whole brain followed by maintenance chemotherapy. One-half of all the patients\nwere randomized to receive one vial (5 x 10(8)) of high viability Pasteur BCG by \nscarification technique given on days 8 and 15 of each 21--28 day treatment\ncycle. Increased granulocytopenia accompanied the addition of BCG immunotherapy. \nPatients receiving BCG achieved a response rate of 49% vs. those patients not\nreceiving BCG of 44% (P = 0.579). Median response duration was 40 weeks for the\nBCG arms and 38 weeks for the arms without BCG; survival was no different, 42\nweeks for the BCG arms vs. 50 weeks for the arms without BCG. In patients who\nresponded to therapy and survived longer than one year, those who continued to\nreceive BCG therapy demonstrated a slight, yet significant, survival benefit over\nthose patients not receiving BCG (93 weeks vs. 81 weeks, P = 0.03). It appears\nthat BCG immunotherapy has no beneficial effect on response rate, duration of\nresponse, or survival in programs using chemotherapy and radiotherapy for control\nof limited small-cell carcinoma of the lung except in this small group of\nlong-term survivors.\n\nPMID: 6280836  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This study examined the effect of oral aspirin and intravenous (i.v.)\nsodium salicylate on acute plasma cortisol response following surgical\ncastration. Twenty bulls, randomly assigned to the following groups, (i)\nuncastrated, untreated controls, (ii) castrated, untreated controls, (iii) 50\nmg/kg sodium salicylate i.v. precastration and (iv) 50 mg/kg aspirin\n(acetylsalicylic acid) per os precastration, were blood sampled at 3, 10, 20, 30,\n40, 50 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h postcastration. Samples were\nanalyzed by competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay and fluorescence\npolarization immunoassay for cortisol and salicylate, respectively. Data were\nanalyzed using noncompartmental analysis, a simple cosine model, anova and\nt-tests. Intravenous salicylate V(d(ss)) was 0.18 L/kg, Cl(B) was 3.36 mL/min/kg \nand t(1/2 lambda) was 0.63 h. Plasma salicylate concentrations above 25 microg/mL\ncoincided with significant attenuation in peak cortisol concentrations (P =\n0.029). Peak salicylate concentrations following oral aspirin administration was \n<10 microg/mL and failed to attenuate cortisol response. Once salicylate\nconcentrations decreased below 5 microg/mL, cortisol response in the castrated\ngroups was significantly higher than uncastrated controls (P = 0.018). These\nfindings have implications for designing drug regimens to provide analgesia\nduring routine animal husbandry procedures.\n\nPMID: 17610403  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. J Endod. 1994 Sep;20(9):427-31.\n\nEffectiveness of various medications on postoperative pain following root canal\nobturation.\n\nTorabinejad M(1), Dorn SO, Eleazer PD, Frankson M, Jouhari B, Mullin RK, Soluti\nA.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Endodontics, School of Dentistry, Loma Linda University,\nCalifornia.\n\nThis prospective study compared the effectiveness of nine medications and a\nplacebo in controlling pain following obturation. A total of 588 patients who\nrequired root canal obturation were included. After obturation of root canals,\neach patient took one of the medications, salicylic acid (2 x 250 mg),\nacetaminophen (2 x 250 mg), ibuprofen (2 x 250 mg), ketoprofen (2 x 250 mg),\nacetaminophen (2 x 250 mg) plus codeine (2 x 250 mg), penicillin (2 x 250 mg),\nerythromycin base (2 x 250 mg), penicillin plus ibuprofen (2 x 250 mg),\nmethylprednisolone (2 x 250 mg) plus penicillin (2 x 250 mg), or a placebo, every\n6 h for 72 h. All medications were encapsulated in identical capsules. The\npatients registered their degree of discomfort on a visual analogue scale of 0 to\n9. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the incidence of postoperative\npain after obturation is lower than that following complete cleaning and shaping \n(5.83% versus 21.76%). In addition, there was no significant difference between\nthe effectiveness of the various medications and placebo tablets in controlling\npostoperative pain following obturation.\n\nPMID: 7996111  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. J Endod. 1994 Jul;20(7):345-54.\n\nEffectiveness of various medications on postoperative pain following complete\ninstrumentation.\n\nTorabinejad M(1), Cymerman JJ, Frankson M, Lemon RR, Maggio JD, Schilder H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Endodontics, School of Dentistry, Loma Linda University,\nCalifornia.\n\nThe root canals of 588 consecutive nonsurgical patients with varying levels of\npain were completely instrumented in 10 endodontic practices and 4 endodontic\ngraduate programs. The participants were sequentially assigned to one of nine\nmedications and a placebo. The severity of pain was assessed by the visual analog\nscale for 72 h following instrumentation. Among all of the parameters studied,\nthree factors (preoperative pain, apprehension, and types of medication) were\nfound to be significant in determining postinstrumentation pain. An association\nwas found between the intensity of pre-and postoperative pain. As the intensity\nof preoperative pain increased, the chances for more severe postoperative pain\nincreased (p < 0.0001). In addition, an association between the presence of\napprehension before any treatment and postoperative pain was also noted (between \n0.012 < p < 0.047). Examination of the time-effect curves for various medications\nin patients with no mild pain showed no statistical significant difference\nbetween the effectiveness of different medications and placebo. However, a\nmultiple comparison of the effectiveness of various medications and placebo on\npatients in moderate and severe preoperative pain showed that ibuprofen,\nketoprofen, erythromycin base, penicillin, and methylprednisolone plus penicillin\nwere more effective than placebo within the first 48 h following complete\ninstrumentation.\n\nPMID: 7996097  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1982 Jun;13(6):807-10.\n\nEfficacy and pharmacokinetics of aspirin in post-operative dental pain.\n\nSeymour RA, Rawlins MD.\n\n1 Soluble aspirin, 600 mg and 1200 mg, and placebo were compared in a\ndouble-blind, cross-over study in 12 patients with post-operative pain following \nremoval of impacted lower third molars. 2 Significant analgesia after 600 mg\naspirin occurred only at 45 min after administration, whereas significant\nanalgesia after 1200 mg aspirin occurred from 45 to 240 min. The 1200 mg dose\nproduced greater analgesia than the 600 mg dose and is to be recommended in\nclinical practice. 3 Plasma concentrations of salicylate and acetylsalicylate\nwere measured after both doses. A significant correlation (rs = 0.876, P less\nthan 0.01) was observed between analgesia and plasma salicylate concentration\nafter 1200 mg aspirin.\n\nPMCID: PMC1402030\nPMID: 7093110  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Bangladesh Med Res Counc Bull. 2000 Apr;26(1):1-7.\n\nEfficacy of sulphasalazine plus methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIslam MN(1), Alam MN, Haq SA, Moyenuzzaman M, Patwary MI, Rahman MH.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Dept. of Medicine, BSMMU, Dhaka.\n\nEarly intervention with slow acting anti-rheumatic drugs (SAARDs) has led to\nimprovement in substantial proportion of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The \npresent open, controlled study was designed to assess whether a combination of\nSAARDs offer any added benefit. Fifty-four adult RA patients were randomly\nallocated to methotrexate (MTX) (n = 27) and MTX plus sulphasalazine (SSZ) (n =\n27) groups. The subjects were followed-up fortnightly for four weeks then monthly\nfor six months. The disease activity was assessed with the help of 10 clinical\nand four laboratory indices. The improvement was graded as: minor, mild decreases\nin indices, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) continued, physician's\nglobal assessment (PGA) decreased by one; marked, acceptable decreases in\nindices, NSAIDs being taken sparingly, PGA decreased by at least 2, and complete,\nall indices normalised and patients discontinued NSAIDs completely. The\nimprovement was considered clinically important when marked or complete\nimprovement occurred. Adverse drug reactions resulted in withdrawal of 4 subjects\nfrom the MTX + SSZ group and 1 from the control groups. Four and three subjects\nin the combined and MTX groups respectively were lost to follow-up. Subjects in\nboth groups showed significant decline in all indices except hemoglobin and\nneutrophil count. The differences between the two groups in the pre-treatment and\npost-treatment values were insignificant. Complete, marked, minor and no\nimprovement occurred in 4 (21%), 12 (63%), 3 (16%) & 0 in the MTX and in 11\n(48%), 7 (30%), 4 (17%) & 1 (4%) in MTX + SSZ groups respectively. The\ndifferences in the rates of complete and clinically important improvement between\nthe two groups were insignificant (P 0.1398 and 0.7092). The incidence of side\neffects was insignificantly higher in the MTX + SSZ group. Most of them were mild\nand transient. The combination of SAARDs offered little added advantage in RA.\nHowever, the higher rate of complete improvement in the combination group\njustifies trials including larger samples.\n\nPMID: 11192489  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Ann Rheum Dis. 1999 Apr;58(4):220-5.\n\nCombination therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis: a randomised, controlled,\ndouble blind 52 week clinical trial of sulphasalazine and methotrexate compared\nwith the single components.\n\nDougados M(1), Combe B, Cantagrel A, Goupille P, Olive P, Schattenkirchner M,\nMeusser S, Paimela L, Rau R, Zeidler H, Leirisalo-Repo M, Peldan K.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Institut de Rhumatologie, Hardy B, H\xc3\xb4pital Cochin, Paris, France.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential clinical benefit of a combination\ntherapy.\nMETHODS: 205 patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), \nnot treated with disease modifying antirheumatoid drugs previously, with an early\n(< or = 1 year duration), active (Disease Activity Score (DAS) > 3.0), rheumatoid\nfactor and/or HLA DR 1/4 positive disease were randomised between sulphasalazine \n(SASP) 2000 (maximum 3000) mg daily (n = 68), or methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 (maximum \n15) mg weekly (n = 69) or the combination (SASP + MTX) of both (n = 68).\nRESULTS: The mean changes in the DAS during the one year follow up of the study\nwas -1.15, -0.87, -1.26 in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively (p = \n0.019). However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of\neither EULAR good responders 34%, 38%, 38% or ACR criteria responders 59%, 59%,\n65% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively. Radiological progression\nevaluated by the modified Sharp score was very modest in the three groups: mean\nchanges in erosion score: +2.4, +2.4, +1.9, in narrowing score: +2.3, +2.1, +1.6 \nand in total damage score: +4.6, +4.5, +3.5, in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX\ngroups respectively. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SASP + MTX\ngroup 91% versus 75% in the SASP and MTX group (p = 0.025). Nausea was the most\nfrequent side effect: 32%, 23%, 49% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups\nrespectively (p = 0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that an early initiation therapy of disease\nmodifying drug seems to be of benefit. However, this study was unable to\ndemonstrate a clinically relevant superiority of the combination therapy although\nseveral outcomes were in favour of this observation. The tolerability of the\nthree treatment modalities seems acceptable.\n\nPMCID: PMC1752864\nPMID: 10364900  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

One hundred and five patients with\nactive, early RA, rheumatoid factor and/or HLA DR1/4 positive were randomized\nbetween sulphasalazine (SSZ) 2000 (maximum 3000) mg daily, or methotrexate (MTX) \n7.5 (maximum 15) mg weekly, or the combination (COMBI) of both, and were followed\nup by a single observer for 52 weeks. The mean change over time per patient,\nincluding all visits, in Disease Activity Score (DAS) was: SSZ: -1.6 (95% CI -2.0\nto -1.2); MTX: -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4); COMBI: -1.9 (-2.2 to -1.6); the difference\nweek 0-week 52 (SSZ, MTX, COMBI respectively); DAS: -1.8, -2.0, -2.3, Ritchie\narticular index: -9.2, -9.5, -10.6, swollen joints: -9.2, -12.4, -14.3,\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate: -17, -21, -28. Nausea occurred significantly more\nin the COMBI group. The numbers of drop-outs due to toxicity were SSZ 9, MTX 2,\nCOMBI 5. In conclusion, there were no significant differences in efficacy between\ncombination and single therapy, only a modest trend favouring COMBI. The results \nof MTX and SSZ were very comparable. Nausea occurred more often in the COMBI\ngroup: the number of withdrawals due to adverse events did not differ\nsignificantly.\n\nPMID: 9374925  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients received\neither sulphasalazine desensitisation, or placebo, for three weeks before\ncommencement of sulphasalazine treatment. The frequency and nature of adverse\neffects and changes in clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity\nwere measured after three and six months.\nRESULTS: Improvement in the efficacy of sulphalasazine (measured by clinical and \nlaboratory parameters) was significant and similar in magnitude in both groups.\nThere was no significant difference between actively and placebo desensitised\npatients as regards the incidence or profile of adverse effects (toxicity).\nCONCLUSION: Pretreatment low dose desensitisation is unhelpful in reducing the\ntoxicity associated with sulphasalazine treatment of RA.\n\nPMCID: PMC1010172\nPMID: 8660109  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In this study we compare\nthe efficacy and toxicity of two doses (1.5 g/day and 3 g/day, 30 patients per\ngroup), and attempt to relate efficacy to serum levels of sulphasalazine and its \nmetabolites. After six months 24 of the low-dose group and 20 of the high-dose\ngroup remained on treatment. Greater improvement was seen in the high-dose group.\nWhen dose was expressed as mg/kg, the dose efficacy ratio became more apparent\nand a dose of greater than 40 mg/kg/day appears to confer greater benefit. No\nrelationship was demonstrated between serum levels of sulphasalazine or its\nmeasured metabolites, and efficacy. We conclude that response to sulphasalazine\nin rheumatoid arthritis is dose dependent but does not relate to serum levels of \nsulphasalazine, sulphapyridine, or acetyl sulphapyridine.\n\nPMID: 2861876  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1983 Oct 15;287(6399):1099-102.\n\nComparison between penicillamine and sulphasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis:\nLeeds-Birmingham trial.\n\nNeumann VC, Grindulis KA, Hubball S, McConkey B, Wright V.\n\nSulphasalazine was first formulated by Svartz in the early 1940s, specifically\nfor use as a remission inducing drug in rheumatoid arthritis. After the\npublication of an unfavourable trial, however, the drug was restricted to\npatients with ulcerative colitis. In the late 1970s sulphasalazine was\nre-examined in rheumatoid arthritis and favourable results reported in "open"\ntrials. A double blind controlled trial was therefore conducted comparing enteric\ncoated sulphasalazine and D-penicillamine in patients with active rheumatoid\narthritis. A total of 63 patients were recruited in two centres; 31 were treated \nwith sulphasalazine and 32 received penicillamine. After 16 weeks\' treatment both\ndrugs had produced significant improvements in clinical score, pain score\nmeasured on a visual analogue scale, grip strength, Ritchie articular index,\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum C reactive protein concentration.\nNausea was the major side effect in the sulphasalazine treated group. No\npotentially dangerous effects of sulphasalazine were encountered in contrast with\nthose seen in the penicillamine group. The results suggest that sulphasalazine is\nan effective and safe drug capable of producing remissions in active rheumatoid\narthritis. They also lend confidence to the use of preliminary "open" trials as a\nmeans of screening for remission inducing drugs in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPMCID: PMC1549360\nPMID: 6138116  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Result.\n\nUrsing B, Alm T, B\xc3\xa1r\xc3\xa1ny F, Bergelin I, Ganrot-Norlin K, Hoevels J, Huitfeldt B,\nJ\xc3\xa4rnerot G, Krause U, Krook A, Lindstr\xc3\xb6m B, Nordle O, Ros\xc3\xa9n A.\n\nSeventy-eight patients with active Crohn's disease participated in a randomized, \ndouble-blind, cross-over trial. The study comprised two 4-mo period. The purpose \nwas to test the efficacy of metronidazole in comparison with that of\nsulfasalazine. As the main evaluation criteria the Crohn's Disease Activity Index\nand plasma levels of orosomucoid were chosen. In the first period no difference\nin efficacy as measured by Crohn's Disease Activity Index was found between the\ntreatment groups. The reduction of the plasma orosomucoid level was significantly\nmore pronounced in the metronidazole group. The hemoglobin concentration\nincreased more in this group than in the sulfasalazine group, possibly due to a\ntoxic effect of sulfasalazine. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased\nsimilarly with both drugs. In 15 patients who had active disease throughout the\nfirst period, Crohn's Disease Activity Index decreased significantly in the\nsecond period for those who switched to metronidazole, but not for those who\nswitched to sulfasalazine. After crossover, no apparent further change in Crohn's\nDisease Activity Index occurred in either of the treatment groups among patients \nwho had responded favorably in the first period. The plasma concentration of\norosomucoid increased significantly among the patients in the sulfasalazine group\nbut not in the metronidazole group. It is therefore concluded that metronidazole \nis slightly more effective than sulfasalazine in the treatment of crohn's\ndisease. It is worthwhile switching the drug regimen from sulfasalazine, when it \nfails, to metronidazole, but not from metronidazole to sulfasalazine.\n\nPMID: 6124474  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

All the patients admitted were not only symptom-free but\nalso showed no evidence of inflammation on sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy. A\npatient was judged to have relapsed when there was a recurrence of colitic\nsymptoms accompanied by sigmoidoscopic and histological evidence of inflammation.\nThe patients who received dummy tablets had more than four times the relapse rate\nof those receiving sulphasalazine. The results were similar in patients who had\nbeen on maintenance treatment with sulphasalazine for less than three years\nbefore entry into the trial and in those who had been on this treatment for more \nthan three years. It is concluded that maintenance treatment of ulcerative\ncolitis with sulphasalazine should be continued indefinitely unless\ncontraindicated by side effects.\n\nPMCID: PMC1412871\nPMID: 4150435  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

German Multicenter Study.\n\nMrowietz U(1), F\xc3\xa4rber L, Henneicke-von Zepelin HH, Bachmann H, Welzel D,\nChristophers E.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Dermatology, University of Kiel, Germany.\n\nBACKGROUND: Although cyclosporine has been found to be effective therapy for\nsevere psoriasis, only limited data exist about efficacy and safety during\nlong-term treatment with a low-dose regimen. Furthermore, little is known about\nthe course of psoriasis after drug withdrawal.\nOBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the results of long-term therapy with\ncyclosporine for severe psoriasis with particular regard to efficacy and safety, \nas well as the disease course after stopping treatment.\nMETHODS: A multicenter study of 217 patients treated with 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg\nper day of cyclosporine was performed. Duration of treatment ranged from 6 to 30 \nmonths followed by a posttreatment period of 3 months. Efficacy was assessed by\nthe Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and safety was monitored by clinical and\nlaboratory investigations.\nRESULTS: Patients with severe psoriasis showing a reduction in the Psoriasis Area\nand Severity Index of 75% with their individual dose of cyclosporine maintained\nclinical improvement during continuous maintenance therapy. Newly occurring side \neffects were less frequent during the maintenance phase than in the induction\nphase. After withdrawal of cyclosporine, worsening of psoriasis requiring\nantipsoriatic therapy was seen in about half of the patients.\nCONCLUSION: Cyclosporine is effective for long-term therapy for severe psoriasis \nand does not lead to severe deterioration of the disease after drug withdrawal.\n\nPMID: 7657870  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2007 Feb 1.\n\nInfliximab does not suppress the tuberculin skin test (purified protein\nderivative).\n\nHatemi G(1), Melikoglu M, Fresko I, Masatlioglu S, Tascilar K, Yazici H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Department of Internal Medicine, \nRheumatology Division and Haydarpasa Numune Hospital, Department of Internal\nMedicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Tuberculin skin testing with purified protein derivative (PPD) is part\nof tuberculosis (TB) screening in patients receiving infliximab. We assessed\nwhether infliximab, a strong inhibitor of inflammation, suppressed dermal\ninduration, the outcome of this test. We also reassessed the booster phenomenon\nand the interobserver variability in tuberculin testing.\nMETHODS: Forty-seven patients with various diagnoses, who had had a PPD test\nbefore infliximab use, were retested after infliximab treatment. The test was\nalso assessed cross-sectionally among 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) \nafter 8.6 [+/- 4.1 standard deviation (SD)] months of infliximab use and in 82\npatients with RA who had never used this agent. Booster phenomenon and the\ninterobserver variability of reading the test were reassessed among 163\ninfliximab-naive patients with RA and Behcet's disease (BD) and 47 healthy\ncontrols.\nRESULTS: Among the 47 patients who received infliximab, and for whom sequential\ndata were available, the mean skin induration was 5.9 +/- 8.0 SD mm before and\n6.1 +/- 7.5 mm after 4.8 +/- 3.7 months of treatment (p = 0.890). In the\ncross-sectional study the mean PPD induration was 7.8 +/- 8.4 mm among\ninfliximab-naive patients with RA, while it was 6.6 +/- 2.1 mm in those receiving\ninfliximab (p = 0.271). Booster phenomenon was observed in 14/49 (29%) of\npatients with RA, 7/31 (23%) of those with BD, and 1/10 of healthy controls.\nInterobserver variability of PPD reading was good (kappa = 0.92).\nCONCLUSION: Infliximab use does not suppress the skin reaction to tuberculin. We \nconfirm the booster phenomenon and that the PPD skin test has an acceptable\ninterobserver reliability for an in vivo test.\n\nPMID: 17299840  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

J Rheumatol. 2001 Oct;28(10):2274-82.\n\nA comparison of cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, and symptomatic therapy in the\ntreatment of psoriatic arthritis.\n\nSalvarani C(1), Macchioni P, Olivieri I, Marchesoni A, Cutolo M, Ferraccioli G,\nCantini F, Salaffi F, Padula A, Lovino C, Dovigo L, Bordin G, Davoli C, Pasero G,\nAlberighi OD.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Rheumatology Service, Arcispedale S. Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia, Italy.\nsalvarani.carlo@asmn.re.it\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of cyclosporine (CSA) with\nthat of symptomatic therapy (ST) alone and sulfasalazine (SSZ) in the treatment\nof psoriatic arthritis (PsA).\nMETHODS: Twelve rheumatology centers recruited 99 patients with active PsA in a\n24 week, prospective, randomized, open, controlled study. The patients were\ntreated with CSA (3 mg/kg/day) or SSZ (2,000 mg/day) plus ST, or ST alone\n(nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, analgesics, and/or prednisone < or = 5\nmg/day). The primary endpoint was the 6 month change in pain. Analyses were on\nthe basis of the intention-to-treat principle.\nRESULTS: In comparison with both SSZ and ST, there was a statistically\nsignificant difference in favor of CSA in terms of the mean changes in the pain\nscore (p < 0.05), which was considered the primary response variable. A\nsignificant decrease in favor of CSA versus ST alone was also observed for\nswollen joint count (p = 0.05), tender joint count (p = 0.01), joint/pain\ntenderness score (p = 0.002), patient and physician global assessment by at least\none point (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively), total Arthritis Impact Measurement\nScale score (p = 0.002), and spondylitis functional index (p = 0.002). There was \na statistically significant difference in the ACR 50% and ACR 70% response rates \nbetween the CSA and ST groups (p = 0.02, 0.05). Comparing the SSZ and ST alone\ngroups, only the spondylitis functional index decreased significantly in the SSZ \ntreated patients (p = 0.03). The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index was\nsignificantly lower in the CSA than in the ST and SSZ groups (p = 0.0001 and\n0.01, respectively). Decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significant\nonly in the SSZ versus the ST group (p = 0.02), whereas reduction in C-reactive\nprotein was significant in the CSA treated patients compared with the ST group (p\n= 0.006). The most common adverse event in the CSA group was mild, reversible\nkidney dysfunction.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this open trial confirm that CSA is well tolerated by \npatients with PsA and suggest that it is more efficacious than ST or SSZ.\n\nPMID: 11669169  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were classified as\ntreatment responders on the basis of meeting predefined improvement criteria in 4\noutcome measures: namely, patient and physician global assessments in all\npatients, morning stiffness and back pain in patients with axial manifestations, \nand joint pain/tenderness scores and joint swelling scores in patients with\nperipheral articular manifestations.\nRESULTS: Six hundred nineteen SNSA patients (264 AS, 221 PsA, and 134 ReA) were\nstudied. One hundred eighty-seven of these patients had only axial manifestations\nof their disease, while 432 patients had peripheral articular manifestations. Of \nthe patients with axial disease, 40.2% of the SSZ group and 43.3% of the placebo \ngroup met the predefined response criteria (P = 0.67). Of the peripheral\narticular group, 59.0% of the SSZ-treated patients and 42.7% of the\nplacebo-treated patients showed a response (P = 0.0007).\nCONCLUSION: In a large group of affected individuals, the response of SNSA\npatients to SSZ appears to be related to the articular manifestations of their\ndisease. These data demonstrate that the axial and peripheral articular\nmanifestations of SNSA respond differently to treatment with SSZ. In SNSA\npatients with persistently active peripheral arthritis, SSZ is safe, well\ntolerated, and effective.\n\nPMID: 10555027  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

For \npatients that were able to tolerate sulfasalazine for at least 3 months a matched\ncontrol was identified who did not receive sulfasalazine. The primary outcome\nmeasures were the tolerability of sulfasalazine, clinical response of the\nactively inflamed joints at 6 and 12 months, and the change in radiographic score\nat 24 months.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six patients received sulfasalazine. Fourteen of 16 patients\ndiscontinued sulfasalazine due to one or more side effects occurring within 3\nmonths of treatment initiation. For the remaining 20 patients, a 50% reduction in\nactively inflamed joint count was noted in 7/20 patients at 6 months and 11/15\npatients at 12 months, compared to 7/19 patients in the control group at 6 months\nand 10/20 patients at 12 months. The mean change in the radiographic score at 24 \nmonths between the 2 groups was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine was not well tolerated in patients with PsA in our\nclinic. For those able to tolerate sulfasalazine, there was no evidence of a\ntreatment effect with respect to articular involvement. In addition,\nsulfasalazine does not appear to halt radiographic progression in PsA.\n\nPMID: 9779850  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Treatment response was based on joint pain/ tenderness and swelling scores\nand physician and patient global assessments.\nRESULTS: Longitudinal analysis revealed a trend favoring SSZ treatment (P =\n0.13). At the end of treatment, response rates were 57.8% for SSZ compared with\n44.6% for placebo (P = 0.05). The Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate\ndeclined more in the PsA patients taking SSZ than in those taking placebo (P <\n0.0001). Adverse reactions were fewer than expected and were mainly due to\nnonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting,\nand diarrhea.\nCONCLUSION: SSZ at a dosage of 2,000 mg/day is well tolerated and may be more\neffective than placebo in the treatment of patients with PsA.\n\nPMID: 8961906  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A total\nof 120 patients were included in nine centres. All patients had active disease\nand fulfilled the criteria of definite psoriatic arthritis of at least 3 months\nduration. They received either SSZ (2.0 g/day) or placebo. Efficacy variables\nincluded pain, patient's overall assessment of joint and skin improvement,\nmorning stiffness, Ritchie articular index, ESR and CRP. An intention-to-treat\n(ITT) analysis was performed for the 117 patients who qualified (three patients\ndid not qualify due to missing data after baseline). A per-protocol analysis was \nperformed for the 81 patients who completed the 6 months study period (SSZ = 38, \nplacebo = 43). Major reasons for withdrawal were inadequate response (SSZ = 4,\nplacebo = 7) and adverse events (SSZ = 8, placebo = 12). Pain was the only\nstatistically significantly different primary outcome variable at end point in\nfavour of SSZ in the ITT analysis. No significant differences were present in\nother clinical or biological variables, although there was a trend in favour of\nSSZ for some variables. SSZ, at a dose of 2.0 g/day, appeared to be a safe\ntreatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis. At this dosage, its efficacy was \nonly demonstrated for the pain variable.\n\nPMID: 8670601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Sulfasalazine has recently gained wide acceptance in \nthe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and beneficial effects have also been\nnoted in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. We report a double blind \nplacebo controlled study of sulfasalazine in PsA.\nMETHODS: Twenty-four patients with active PsA were randomized to receive either\nsulfasalazine (3 g/day) (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14) for 8 weeks, in a double\nblind manner, followed by an 8 week open label crossover phase for nonresponding \nplacebo patients.\nRESULTS: Compared with placebo controls, sulfasalazine treated patients were\nsignificantly improved at Weeks 4 and 8 with respect to physician (p < 0.01) and \npatient (p < 0.05) global assessments. Duration of morning stiffness was\nsignificantly decreased at Week 8 (p < 0.01). Clinical variables of disease\nactivity returned to baseline after a 4 week drug washout period in 5 evaluable\npatients. Six patients in the placebo group crossed over to an 8 week open label \nphase and demonstrated significant improvements in joint scores, 50 ft walking\ntime, and global patient assessment. Sulfasalazine treated patients also showed\nsignificant improvements in cutaneous involvement.\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine was effective in PsA, with efficacy observed as early\nas the 4th week of treatment. Longterm studies are needed to determine whether\nsuch therapy can modify disease outcome.\n\nPMID: 8587078  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were \ntreated with SSZ (3 gm/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy variables were the\nphysician's and patient's overall assessments, pain, and morning stiffness. End\npoints were analyzed in the intent-to-treat and completer patient populations;\nthe time course of effect was analyzed in the completer patient population.\nRESULTS: Of the 351 patients enrolled, 263 (75%) completed the 6-month treatment \nperiod. The withdrawal rates were 35 (20%) and 53 (30%) in the placebo and SSZ\ngroups, respectively. In the intent-to-treat analysis of end point efficacy, the \nbetween-treatment difference reached statistical significance only for 1 of the 4\nprimary outcome variables, the patient's overall assessment of disease activity, \nfor which 60% of the patients taking SSZ improved by at least 1 point on a\n5-point scale, in contrast to 44% of the patients taking placebo. Laboratory\nmarkers of inflammation also showed statistically significant change in favor of \nSSZ. In subgroup analysis, the most impressive effects were seen in patients with\npsoriatic arthritis, both for the 4 primary efficacy variables and for secondary \nefficacy variables such as the number of inflamed joints. Adverse events were\nmore frequent in the SSZ group than the placebo group, but all were transient or \nreversible after cessation of treatment.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study show that SSZ had greater efficacy than\nplacebo in the treatment of active spondylarthropathy, notably in patients with\npsoriatic arthritis.\n\nPMID: 7748217  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

By 24 wk the articular index in placebo group was still showing\nbenefit. In addition to articular index the SASP group improved significantly in \nterms of visual analogue scale, duration of morning stiffness and ESR. SASP is\neffective in PSA but the partial clinical response to placebo indicates the\nimportance of placebo-controlled studies in this variable disease.\n\nPMID: 8104656  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Ter Arkh. 1992;64(5):54-9.\n\n[The comparative efficacy of slow-acting (basic) preparations in psoriatic\narthritis].\n\n[Article in Russian]\n\nBurde\xc4\xadny\xc4\xad AP, Agababova ER, Korotaeva TV, Kharamil'o LF.\n\nOverall 126 patients with verified and clinically active psoriatic arthritis (PA)\nwere subjected to a randomized study of the efficacy of chrisanolum (Chr),\nsulfasalicylic drugs (SSD) (sulfasalazine and salazopyridazine) and methotrexate \n(MT) as compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). The treatment\nthat lasted for a year was completed by 77 patients: in the group on NSAID, by\n31, on Chr by 15, on SSD by 15, and on MT by 16. In the remainder, the treatment \nwas discontinued because of side effects. The best clinical effect was recorded\nin patients on Chr. The improvement was observed in 73% of the patients, with a\nsignificant effect being attained in 60%. In the groups on SSD and MT, the\nimprovement was observed in 80 and 69%, respectively. However, noticeable\nimprovement was only recorded in 20 and 19%. SSD turned out more effective than\nMT. in the group on NAID, the improvement was ascertained but in 35% of the\npatients, with noticeable one being attained in 6%. According to Pearson's\ncriterion chi 2, the results of the treatment with NAID alone were less potent\nthan in the group given Chr (p < 0.001) and SSD (p < 0.05). The differences\nbetween the effect of the treatment with NAID and MT appeared nonsignificant (p >\n0.1). Therefore, according to the diminution of the clinical efficacy in PA, the \nbasic drugs may be distributed in the following way: Chr, SSD, MT. The\nside-effects in the group on NAID were. recorded in 37% of cases, in the group on\nChr in 53%, on SSD in 33%, and on MT in 55%. This means that SSD were tolerated\nbest of all.\n\nPMID: 1360714  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We now provide a 10-year update of this trial.\nMETHODS: Between November 11, 1977, and February 28, 1983, 1166 patients with\nresected Dukes' stage B and C adenocarcinoma of the colon were stratified by\nDukes' stage, sex, and age (<65 years or > or =65 years) and then randomly\nassigned to receive no further treatment (surgery alone; 394 patients), adjuvant \nchemotherapy (379 patients), or adjuvant immunotherapy (393 patients). Those\neligible for follow-up included 375 (95.2%) patients in the surgery-alone group, \n349 (92.1%) patients in the adjuvant-chemotherapy group, and 372 (94.7%) patients\nin the adjuvant-immunotherapy group. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS: No difference was observed between patients in the chemotherapy group\nand those in the surgery-alone group in 10-year disease-free survival (hazard\nratio [HR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94 to 1.39;P =.17) or overall\nsurvival (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.38; P=.27). Immunotherapy did not appear \nto prevent tumor relapse after 10 years (for surgery alone versus immunotherapy, \nrelative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.25; P =.93) but had a beneficial\neffect on 10-year overall survival (for surgery alone versus immunotherapy, RR = \n1.27, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.56; P =.02) that apparently results from a reduction in \ndeaths associated with comorbidities in the immunotherapy group.\nCONCLUSION: The disease-free and overall survival benefit associated with\nchemotherapy in this patient population is of limited duration, disappearing\nafter 10 years.\n\nPMID: 15292384  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The adoptive transfer of these cells can result in tumor\nregression.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV renal cell cancer (RCC) were\nvaccinated with irradiated autologous tumor cells admixed with Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin\nbacillus. Approximately 7 days later, vaccine-primed lymph nodes (VPLNs) were\nharvested and the lymphoid cells secondarily activated with anti-CD3 monoclonal\nantibody and expanded in interleukin 2 (IL-2). The activated cells were\nsubsequently infused intravenously along with the concomitant administration of\nbolus IL-2 (360,000 U/kg intravenously x 15 doses).\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were entered onto the study, of whom 34 completed\nan initial course of cell therapy consisting of a mean (SEM) number of 4.3 (2.2) \nx 10(10) VPLN cells. Among subjects who received cell therapy, there were nine\nresponses (four complete responses [CRs] and five partial responses [PRs]), for\nan overall response rate of 27%. The durations of the CRs were > 48, 45, > 35,\nand 12 months, and the durations of the PRs were > 63, 48, 15, 12, and 4 months. \nCultured tumor cells were available to assess in vitro cytokine release of VPLN\ncells in 24 subjects. The median cytokine release ratio of interferon gamma\n(IFNgamma) to IL-10 for responders and nonresponders was 992 and 5, respectively,\nwhich was significantly different (P =.047).\nCONCLUSION: The treatment protocol resulted in durable tumor responses in\npatients with advanced RCC. The ratio of IFNgamma and IL-10 cytokines released in\nresponse to tumor by the VPLN cells was a significant correlate with tumor\nresponse.\n\nPMID: 12610189  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

There were no\ndifferences between BCG-treated and control patients in sex, age, cigarettes\nsmoked per day, pack-years of cigarette smoking, white blood cell count, or\nnumber of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Toxicity of BCG was limited to transient \nmalaise and fever (average peak temperature, 38.7 degrees C). There was no\nsignificant difference in outcome (recurrence or survival) between BCG-treated\nand control groups with Stage I or Stage III tumors; there were too few Stage II \ntumors for separate statistical analysis. Outcome was not affected within or\nbetween the two treatment groups by tuberculin skin test status. Combining both\ntreatment groups, Stage III patients had a worse outcome than did Stage I-II\npatients, non-squamous cell tumor patients (large cell and adenocarcinoma) had\nworse outcomes than did squamous cell tumor patients, and men had a worse outcome\nthan women. We conclude that, although preoperative intratumoral BCG therapy is\nsafe, it does not lengthen disease-free interval or prolong survival in patients \nwith non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPMID: 3530442  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Outcome\nand complications].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nToomes H.\n\nIn two prospective, randomized clinical studies Corynebacterium parvum (C.p.),\nBCG or 0.9% saline solution were injected intrapleurally once between the 6th and\n12th postoperative day in 878 patients with resected, non-oatcell bronchial\ncarcinoma (stage I and II). The rate of complications following C.p.-instillation\n(chest pain, fever) was relatively low compared to partially serious\ncomplications following injection of BCG, especially in patients who underwent\npneumonectomy (21.8% empyema compared to 3.2% in the placebo group). After an\naverage follow-up of 4.6 years in the first study, 110 of 207 C.p.-treated\npatients (53%) were dead compared to 82 of 198 in the placebo group (41%). The\ndifference is statistically significant (P less than 0.02). In the second study, \n79 out of 197 BCG-treated patients (40%) were dead after an average follow-up of \n2.8 years compared to 71 out of 208 placebo-treated patients (34%). This\ndifference is not statistically significant. From these data it is concluded that\npostoperative immunotherapy as performed in these studies is not only of no\nbenefit to the patients, but might even be detrimental as a result of an\nincreased posttherapeutic complication rate and a partially diminished\nexpectation of life.\n\nPMID: 6376041  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Of 47 patients administered \nMER 400 mcg intradermally every six weeks, 12 (26%) attained complete remission\nwith a median survival of 22.9 months. Complete remission was observed in 17\n(31%) of 55 patients who received no MER with a median survival of 20.0 months (P\ngreater than 0.05). Survival greater than or equal to 2 years has been observed\nin five patients who received MER and two patients who did not receive MER. The\nresponse rate and duration, survival, and toxicity of the two treatment arms were\nsimilar with the exception of cutaneous and occasional systemic reaction to MER. \nMER as used in this study has not influenced the overall results of a combined\nmodality treatment program for patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n\nPMID: 6282434  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Cancer. 1982 Jun 1;49(11):2252-8.\n\nCombination chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and BCG immunotherapy in limited\nsmall-cell carcinoma of the lung: a Southwest Oncology Group Study.\n\nMcCracken JD, Chen T, White J, Samson M, Stephens R, Coltman CA Jr, Saiki J, Lane\nM, Bonnet J, McGavran M.\n\nFrom November 1976 to March 1979 the Southwest Oncology Group treated 298\npatients with limited (disease confined to the chest and encompassed by one\nradiotherapy port) small-cell carcinoma of the lung with combination chemotherapy\nand radiotherapy with or without BCG immunotherapy. Two induction chemotherapy\nprograms were utilized: (1) cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate,\nfluorouracil; or (2) cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine. Patients\nreceived 4500 rads of radiation therapy to the bulk primary tumor and 3000 rads\nto whole brain followed by maintenance chemotherapy. One-half of all the patients\nwere randomized to receive one vial (5 x 10(8)) of high viability Pasteur BCG by \nscarification technique given on days 8 and 15 of each 21--28 day treatment\ncycle. Increased granulocytopenia accompanied the addition of BCG immunotherapy. \nPatients receiving BCG achieved a response rate of 49% vs. those patients not\nreceiving BCG of 44% (P = 0.579). Median response duration was 40 weeks for the\nBCG arms and 38 weeks for the arms without BCG; survival was no different, 42\nweeks for the BCG arms vs. 50 weeks for the arms without BCG. In patients who\nresponded to therapy and survived longer than one year, those who continued to\nreceive BCG therapy demonstrated a slight, yet significant, survival benefit over\nthose patients not receiving BCG (93 weeks vs. 81 weeks, P = 0.03). It appears\nthat BCG immunotherapy has no beneficial effect on response rate, duration of\nresponse, or survival in programs using chemotherapy and radiotherapy for control\nof limited small-cell carcinoma of the lung except in this small group of\nlong-term survivors.\n\nPMID: 6280836  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

When the two\nimmunotherapy arms were combined and plotted against controls, trend analysis\nsuggested (P = 0.088) an increase in disease-free interval (DFI) only for stage I\npatients. The one-way mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) values were depressed in\nsome patients prior to any immune stimulation. Immunotherapy significantly\nbenefited DFI among patients with a depressed MLC.\n\nPMID: 7036285  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, BCG\nimmunotherapy alone seems to be superior in terms of survival to no therapy,\nchemotherapy, and immunochemotherapy. This could be due to a better tolerance to \nsecondary treatments given at time of recurrence.\n\nPMID: 7036284  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

J Neurooncol. 1996 Feb;27(2):179-89.\n\nAutologous tumor cell vaccination combined with adoptive cellular immunotherapy\nin patients with grade III/IV astrocytoma.\n\nHolladay FP(1), Heitz-Turner T, Bayer WL, Wood GW.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Neurosurgery Division, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, 66160,\nUSA\n\nBrain tumors are highly resistant to treatment. Their diffuse infiltrative nature\nand the relative inaccessibility of the brain to blood and lymph are barriers to \nsurgical and cytotoxic treatments alike. Preclinical animal studies demonstrated \nthat intravenously administered tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes will reject \ntumors growing in the brain. Specifically activated effector T lymphocytes may be\ngenerated by in vivo immunization followed by restimulation of antigen-primed T\ncells with autologous tumor cells in vitro. In order to apply these findings to\nhumans, feasibility studies of combined active immunization and specific adoptive\ncellular immunotherapy were performed on fifteen patients with recurrent\nastrocytoma. The objective was to determine whether; 1) T cells could be grown\nfrom peripheral blood of patients immunized with autologous tumor cells, and 2)\nwhether stimulated cells could be safely readministered to patients. Patients\nwere immunized with a combination of their own irradiated tumor cells and\nBacillus of Calmette and Guerin. Two weeks later a mononuclear cell-rich fraction\nof blood was obtained by leukapheresis. Mononuclear cells were cultured with\nirradiated autologous tumor cells and interleukin-2. Selective expansion of CD4+ \nand CD8+ T lymphocytes occurred. Intravenous transfer of stimulated cells to the \nfifteen patients on twenty-four separate occasions with or without systemic\nadministration of interleukin-2 was tolerated with limited toxicity. The studies \nestablished the feasibility of conducting controlled studies of the anti-tumor\neffects of tumor antigen-specific cellular immunotherapy.\n\nPMID: 8699241  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the treatment group, 36 patients received BCG-PSN 0.5 mg\nintramuscular injection, quaque die alterna, for 18 times. All patients revisited\nthe hospital every 2 weeks and were followed up for 6 months. The number and days\nof patients with acute attack in 3 and 6 months were assessed. In the treatment\ngroup, the blood samples were collected before treatment and 3 and 6 months after\ntreatment for the measurement of the blood IgA, IgG, IgM, CD3, CD4 and CD8.\nRESULTS: The number and days of patients with acute attack in the treatment group\nwere significantly lower than those in the control group. After the treatment by \nBCG-PSN, blood CD4 and CD4/CD8 were significantly increased.\nCONCLUSION: BCG-PSN increases the patient's cellular immunocompetence and thus\nserves as a good protection against the acute attack of chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease.\n\nPMID: 12599448  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2011\nMay 8.\n\nRelationship between active inflammatory lesions in the spine and sacroiliac\njoints and new development of chronic lesions on whole-body MRI in early axial\nspondyloarthritis: results of the ESTHER trial at week 48.\n\nSong IH(1), Hermann KG, Haibel H, Althoff CE, Poddubnyy D, Listing J, Weiss A,\nFreundlich B, Rudwaleit M, Sieper J.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Rheumatology, Charit\xc3\xa9 Medical University, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin,\nGermany.\n\nAIM: To investigate the relationship between active inflammatory lesions on\nwhole-body MRI (wb-MRI) and new development of chronic lesions on T1 MRI in\npatients with early axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) treated either with etanercept \n(ETA) or sulfasalazine (SSZ).\nMETHODS: Wb-MRIs of 65 patients treated either with ETA (n=35) or SSZ (n=30) over\n1 year were scored for active inflammation, fatty lesions, erosions and ankylosis\nin the 23 vertebral units (VUs) of the spine and in the sacroiliac joints (SI\njoints). Scoring was performed by two blinded radiologists.\nRESULTS: If there was no previous inflammation in the bone no new fatty lesions\noccurred in SI joint quadrants and only a few (0.6%) in spine VUs. There was a\nsignificant relationship between disappearance of inflammation and the appearance\nof fatty lesions: if baseline inflammation resolved fatty lesions occurred in\n10.5% of SI joint quadrants and 17.9% of VUs. If inflammation did not resolve\nover 1 year, fatty lesions occurred less frequently: 2.4% (SI joint quadrants)\nand 7.2% (VUs). There was a significantly higher increase of the mean fatty\nlesion score between baseline and week 48 in the ETA (4.0 vs 4.8 for the SI\njoints and 1.9 vs 2.7 for the spine) compared to the SSZ (3.0 vs 3.2 for the SI\njoints and 1.1 vs 1.2 for the spine, respectively) group (p=0.001 and p=0.020 for\nthe differences). No significant changes in the erosion or ankylosis score were\nobserved in any of the two groups during this time.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that there is a close interaction between\ninflammation, tumour necrosis factor blockade and the development of fatty\nlesions in subchondral bone marrow of patients with axial SpA.\n\nPMCID: PMC3103667\nPMID: 21551507  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

One hundred thirty-two\nindividuals with recurrent and/or multiple neoplasms, i.e. at high risk for\ntumour recurrence and progression, were enrolled. After complete transurethral\nresection of their tumours, the patients received a 6-week course of BCG\ninstillations or an early 4-week course of epirubicin instillations as their\ninitial therapy. Those with stage Ta and grade 1 neoplasms who remained free of\nrecurrences received maintenance therapy consisting of single quarterly\ninstillations. However, for those with stage T1 cancer of any grade or stage Ta\nof grade 2 or 3 neoplasms who also remained free of recurrences, the treatment\nschedules were modified: they received, instead of single maintenance doses, 3\nweekly instillations of epirubicin at months 3 and 6 of follow-up, or a 3-week\ncourse of BCG at month 6 of follow-up. The recurrence-free rates did not differ\nsignificantly between the two study groups (44% for epirubicin versus 55% for\nBCG), for an identical median follow-up of 43 months. However, in terms of\nrelative risk of recurrences, disease-free intervals and recurrence rate per 100 \npatient-months, a significant benefit in favour of BCG when compared with\nepirubicin was demonstrated in patients who had stage T1 or grade 3 neoplasms.\n\nPMID: 8692531  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Results from\nmultiple clinical trials conducted in the past 10 years have been disappointing\nin patients with locally advanced or disseminated disease, but immunotherapy has \ncontributed significantly to the successful treatment of superficial bladder\ntumors. Immunotherapy offers improved means of eradicating existing tumors and,\nmore important, preventing potentially life-threatening new tumor occurrences by \nfavorably altering preneoplastic lesions (chemoprevention).\n\nPMID: 6400156  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

These patients were randomized by an\nenvelope method after operation and divided into three treatment groups:\n'control', 'chemotherapy', and 'chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with BCG-CWS.'\nOnly two patients who died during surgery were excluded, and a survey of survival\nperiods was made on the remaining 138 patients in January 1982. As a result,\nstatistically significant differences in the survival rate curve were observed\nbetween the control and chemotherapy plus immunotherapy groups (P less than\n0.01), and between the chemotherapy and chemotherapy plus immunotherapy groups (P\nless than 0.05). These results emphasize effectiveness of BCG-CWS as an adjuvant \nimmunotherapeutic agent in gastrectomized cancer patients.\n\nPMID: 6340825  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The well-tolerated, oral\ncombination chemotherapy with six cycles of Leukeran plus methotrexate plus\nfluorouracil (LMF) plus repeated BCG skin scarifications was used. After 4 years,\nthe following results were seen: (1) significant increase of relapse-free (RFS)\nand also overall survival (S) in both pre- and postmenopausal node-negative\npatients versus surgical controls (RFS 91.1 vs. 701%, P = 0.003; S 96 vs. 88%, P \n= 0.03); (2) no significant increase of RFS or S in pre- and postmenopausal\nnode-positive patients versus surgical controls (RFS 50.1 versus 44%, P = 0.49; S\n70 versus 68 %, P = 0.9, respectively); (3) Patients receiving greater than 90%\nof the planned LMF dose showed significantly better survival after 4 years; and\n(4) Nonrandomized comparison with concurrent Swiss adjuvant studies with LMF\nalone indicate no beneficial or harmful effect of BCG skin scarifications in\naddition to the six-cycle LMF.\n\nPMID: 7036281  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were randomly allocated to receive no immunotherapy or\nimmunotherapy consisting of methanol extracted residue of bacillus\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (0.5 mg intradermally; 100 microgram in five separate sites)\nevery 5 weeks, concomitant with chemotherapy. Of these 28 evaluable patients, 13 \nreceived chemoimmunotherapy with one complete response (CR) and 15 received\nchemotherapy alone with one CR. Both responses occurred in lymph node metastases.\nNo partial responses were seen.\n\nPMID: 356970  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1976 Nov;44:85-6.\n\nImmunotherapy in malignant melanomaa.\n\nHomes EC, Morton DL, Eilber FR, Golub SE, Sulit HL.\n\nAccumlated evidence suggests that human neoplasms contain antigens that elicit\nhumoral and cellular immunity in the immunocompetent host. A recent summary\nreport showed that Stage II melanoma patients with metastases to regional lymph\nnodes had a lowered incidence of recurrence and a higher incidence of survival\nfollowing surgery and postoperative BCG immunotherapy. To verify these findings, \nclinical trials are now under way in which we radomized melanoma patients into\ngroups to compare treatment by surgery alone with surgery and BCG only, or\nsurgery and BCG in combination with allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine. Serum\nsamples from each patient are monitored by in vitro techniques to define those\nmethods which best correlate to clinical course. Hopefully, such correlations can\nbe used to monitor response to immunotherapy before disease is clinically\napparent. Although immunotherapy does not cause regression of far advanced\ndisease, it undoubtedly will be beneficial against subclinical, microscopic\ntumor.\n\nPMID: 799763  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is becoming popular as an alternative to oral and injection delivery\nsystem because it is non-invasive, non-traumatic, and painless and also because\nof its specific delivery system.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of\nsodium salicylate iontophoresis in the management of hip pain in patient with\nsickle cell disorders (SCD).\nMETHOD: The participants for this study were 20 patients with SCD, their ages\nranged from 15-30 years. They were randomly assigned into two groups of 10 (study\nand control groups. All the participants were given conventional physiotherapy\nand their regular medications. In addition sodium salicylate iontophoresis was\ngiving to the affected hip of the participants in the study group using a\ngalvanic current machine. Pain intensity and range of motion at the hip joint\nwere assessed at the beginning and after 10 treatment sessions. Data were\nanalyzed using Mann Whitney U test and paired t-test for the visual analogue\nscale and goniometric values respectively.\nRESULT: The results showed that there was a statistically significant reduction\nin pain intensity only in the participants in the study group (p<0.05), there was\nalso a statistically significant improvement in the hip range of motion of the\nparticipants in the study group (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: It was concluded that sodium salicylate iontophoresis was effective\nin the management of hip pain in patients with SCD. It is therefore recommended\nfor routine use for patients with SCD on admission with severe pain.\n\nPMID: 18318099  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Br J Dermatol. 2006 Jul;155(1):182-5.\n\nAn evaluation of the efficacy of topical application of salicylic acid for the\ntreatment of familial cylindromatosis.\n\nOosterkamp HM(1), Neering H, Nijman SM, Dirac AM, Mooi WJ, Bernards R,\nBrummelkamp TR.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis and Center for Biomedical Genetics, The\nNetherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nBACKGROUND: Familial cylindromatosis is a rare genetic disorder, giving rise to\nneoplasms of the skin appendages. We have recently shown that loss of the\ncylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene leads to activation of NF-kappaB, a\ntranscription factor having antiapoptotic activity. This provides a possible\nexplanation for the deregulated growth of cylindromas. In cell-based assays,\nsalicylate can prevent NF-kappaB activation caused by loss of the cylindromatosis\ngene, suggesting that salicylic acid application might be a potential treatment\nfor cylindromatosis.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of topical application of salicylic acid \non familial cylindromas.\nMETHODS: Cylindromas in five patients from four different cylindromatosis\nfamilies were treated with twice daily and then once daily topical salicylic\nacid. Clinical response was determined by serial tumour measurements.\nRESULTS: In total 17 cylindromas in five patients were studied: 12 target lesions\nand five control lesions. The median size of the cylindromas was 1.0 cm (range,\n0.6-2.8 cm). Two of the 12 cylindromas showed a complete remission. Another eight\nlesions showed some response, but not sufficient to qualify as partial remission.\nThe control lesions remained stable or increased in size.\nCONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid is a well-tolerated and potential new treatment for\ncylindromatosis.\n\nPMID: 16792771  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ann Fam Med. 2013 Sep-Oct;11(5):437-41. doi: 10.1370/afm.1508.\n\nNatural course of cutaneous warts among primary schoolchildren: a prospective\ncohort study.\n\nBruggink SC(1), Eekhof JA, Egberts PF, van Blijswijk SC, Assendelft WJ, Gussekloo\nJ.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Center,\nLeiden, The Netherlands.\n\nPURPOSE: Because cutaneous warts resolve spontaneously and available treatments\noften fail, family physicians and patients may consider a wait-and-see policy. We\nexamined the natural course of cutaneous warts and treatment decisions in a\nprospective observational cohort of primary schoolchildren.\nMETHODS: We inspected the hands and feet of children aged 4 to 12 years from 3\nDutch primary schools for the presence of warts at baseline and after a mean\nfollow-up of 15 months. Parental questionnaires at follow-up provided information\non inconvenience caused by warts and any treatments used.\nRESULTS: Of the 1,134 eligible children, 1,099 (97%) participated, of whom 366\n(33%) had cutaneous warts at baseline. Among these children with warts, loss to\nfollow-up was 9% and the response rate to the parental questionnaires was 83%.\nThe complete resolution rate was 52 per 100 person-years at risk (95% CI, 44-60).\nYounger age (hazard ratio = 1.1 per year decrease; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2) and\nnon-Caucasian skin type (hazard ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) increased the\nlikelihood of resolution. During follow-up, 38% of children with warts at\nbaseline treated their warts: 18% used over-the-counter treatment only, 15% used \na family physician-provided treatment only, and 5% used both. Children were more \nlikely to initiate treatment if the warts measured at least 1 cm in diameter\n(odds ratio = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.9-5.3) and especially if parents reported that the\nwarts caused inconvenience (odds ratio = 38; 95% CI, 16-90).\nCONCLUSIONS: One-half of primary schoolchildren with warts will be free of warts \nwithin 1 year. Young age and non-Caucasian skin type enhance resolution. Children\nwith large or inconvenient warts are more likely to start treatment. These\nfindings will be useful in the process of shared decision making with parents and\nchildren.\n\nPMCID: PMC3767712\nPMID: 24019275  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This study investigated electroencephalography\n(EEG) parameters and cortisol levels in calves receiving intravenous sodium\nsalicylate in response to a castration model. Twelve Holstein calves were\nrandomly assigned to the following groups: (i) castrated, untreated controls,\n(ii) 50 mg/kg sodium salicylate IV precastration, were blood sampled at 0, 5, 10,\n20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 360, and 480 min postcastration. The EEG \nrecording included baseline, castration, immediate recovery (0-5 min after\ncastration), middle recovery (5-10 min after castration), and late recovery\n(10-20 min after castration). Samples were analyzed by competitive\nchemiluminescent immunoassay and fluorescence polarization immunoassay for\ncortisol and salicylate, respectively. EEG visual inspection and spectral\nanalysis were performed. Statistical analyses included anova repeated measures\nand correlations between response variable. No treatment effect was noted between\nthe two groups for cortisol and EEG measurements, namely an attenuation of acute \ncortisol response and EEG desynchronization in sodium salicylate group. Time\neffects were noted for EEG measurements, cortisol and salicylates levels.\nSignificant correlations between cortisol and EEG parameters were noted. These\nfindings have implications for designing effective analgesic regimens, and they\nsuggest that EEG can be useful to monitor pain attributable to castration.\n\n\xc2\xa9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\n\nPMID: 21303378  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Many patients\nwith OA of the hand have areas of tender subcutaneous thickening in the forearm\nand upper scapular region. A pilot study showed an improvement in pain from OA at\nthe first carpometacarpal joint after injection of such areas with 0.5% sodium\nsalicylate or saline, an inexpensive treatment that can be administered by\ngeneral practitioners and nurses. The study indicated that a randomised,\nsham-controlled trial was justified.\nMETHODS: 40 patients with OA of the first carpometacarpal joint were randomised\nto receive either injections of sodium salicylate into tender, thickened areas of\nsubcutaneous tissue on the forearm (baseline) and upper scapular region (week 1) \nor sham injections consisting of pressure without skin penetration. Blinded\nassessments were made at weeks 3, 7 and 13 after baseline.\nRESULTS: Pain and tenderness during follow-up were both significantly lower in\nthe active treatment group compared with the sham group: 19% and 14% greater\nreduction in mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score, respectively (p=0.007 and\n0.02, baseline mean 5.65 and 5.35 cm, average difference in change from baseline \nVAS 1.9 and 1.4 cm, 95% CI 0.6 to 3.2 and 0.2 to 2.5). Active and sham injections\nwere painful, the former significantly more so; however, there was no significant\ncorrelation between the pain of active injections and response.\nCONCLUSION: The data show that subcutaneous sodium salicylate injections are an\neffective symptomatic treatment for OA of the thumb. The results provide a basis \nfor further physiological and therapeutic research in this area.\n\nPMID: 20547600  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Twenty (20)\nsubjects participated in this study. Their ages ranged from 40-65 years. They\nwere assigned to either the TENS or Iontophoresis group. The application of TENS \nwas done using an EV 904 unit made by. Electro-medical supplies, while\nIontophoresis treatment was delivered using a Galvanic current machine by F.W.\nRead and Sons London. The subjects levels of pain and functional disability prior\nto commencement of treatment and after the 6 weeks of treatment was taken using\nthe Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Disability Index Questionnaire for patients\nwith osteoarthritis of the knee joint(s). Analysis of data obtained was done\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test and level of significance was set at (P < 0.05).\nThe statistical analysis of the result showed a statistically significant\nreduction in pain and functional disability in both groups (P < 0.05). Patients\ntreated with Sodium salicylate iontophoresis had a more statistically significant\nreduction of pain and functional disability in comparison with TENS group (P <\n0.05). It is hereby suggested that the use of sodium salicylate iontophoresis and\nTENS be included in treatment of osteoarthritis to enhance pain relief and\nfunctional activity.\n\nPMID: 17688170  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

I.Lizarraga@massey.ac.nz\n\nThe level within the central nervous system where non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs (NSAIDs) produce analgesia and the mechanisms by which they mediate this\neffect are still uncertain. This study assessed the central analgesic effects of \nketoprofen, phenylbutazone, salicylic acid and tolfenamic acid in sheep implanted\nwith indwelling intrathecal (i.t.) catheters and submitted to mechanical noxious \nstimulation. The sheep received i.t. cumulative concentrations (0.375-200 microM;\n100 microL) as well as a single intravenous (i.v.) dose (3, 8, 10 and 2 mg/kg,\nrespectively) of each NSAID. The sheep were also given i.t. naloxone (5.49 mM;\n100 microL) and atipamezole (4.03 mM; 100 microL) prior to i.v. ketoprofen. None \nof the i.t. NSAIDs increased mechanical thresholds. Intravenously, only\nketoprofen and tolfenamic acid raised the pain thresholds. The hypoalgesic effect\nof i.v. ketoprofen was prevented by i.t. naloxone or atipamezole. Although NSAIDs\nhad no direct effect on the spinal cord, their analgesic action appeared to be\nspinally mediated.\n\nPMID: 16085153  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Based on this fact we developed\na fixed combination of 500 mg ASA and 30 mg PSE, the recommended doses for both\ndrugs for treating symptoms of the common cold, as granulate to be dissolved in\nwater for administration. The purpose of this open, randomized, three-factorial\n(three-treatment, three-period, six-sequence) Latin Square clinical study was to \ninvestigate the relative bioavailability of ASA and PSE as well as the\nestablishment of bioequivalence after single administration of the fixed\ncombination (final formulation for approval) of 500 mg ASA/30 mg PSE*HCl and the \npreliminary formulation of this combination. Pharmacokinetic characteristics\nAUC(norm) and C(max,norm) of ASA, its metabolite SA, and PSE, were determined as \nmeasure of rate and extent of absorption of the two formulations. The treatment\nratios final/preliminary formulation and their corresponding 90% confidence\nintervals were calculated to establish bioequivalence. Additionally, descriptive \nstatistics were calculated for the parameters t(max), t((1/2)), and mean\nresidence time (MRT). In total, data from 18 healthy male volunteers were\nincluded in the pharmacokinetic evaluation. The primary target parameters were\nanalyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) after logarithmic transformation\nof the data. Confidence intervals of 90% were calculated for the geometric means \nof ratios using the mean square error term of the ANOVA. Bioequivalence criteria \nwere fulfilled for AUC(norm) and C(max,norm). Geometric means of individual\nratios of AUC(norm) and of C(max,norm) showed equal bioavailability of the new\nformulation compared with the preliminary. Furthermore, a relative\nbioavailability of approximately 100% of the preliminary formulation was shown\nfor the newly developed formulation for all parameters. The parameters t(max),\nt((1/2)), and MRT showed comparable results for ASA, SA, and PSE, respectively,\nin both formulations. The supplementary evaluation for the non-normalized\noriginal parameters AUC and C(max) also revealed bioequivalence. For the newly\ndeveloped formulation, the arithmetic means of the parameters AUC and C(max) for \nPSE were 1040.66 mg/h*l and 134.52 mg/l, for SA 142.28 mg/h*l and 30.34 mg/l,\nrespectively. The median t(max) values were 0.67 h for PSE and 0.92 h for SA.\nBoth treatments were safe and well tolerated.\n\n(c) 2003 Prous Science.

Patients were randomised\nto three parallel groups consisting of two active treatment gels, containing\nescin (1% or 2%), 5% diethylammonium salicylate, and 5000 IU heparin, or placebo \ngel. Tenderness produced by pressure was measured at 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,\nand 24 hours after enrollment (within two hours of the injury). Tenderness was\ndefined as the amount of pressure (measured by a calibrated caliper at the centre\nof the injury) that first produced a pain reaction as reported by the patient.\nRESULTS: A total of 158 patients were enrolled; 156 were evaluated in the\nintention to treat analysis. The primary efficacy variable was the area under the\ncurve for tenderness over a six hour period. The gel preparations containing 1%\nand 2% escin were significantly more effective (a priori ordered hypotheses\ntesting controlling the multiple alpha = 5% significance level) than placebo\n(p(1) = 0.0001 and p(2) = 0.0002 respectively). The treatment effects were 5.7 kp\nh/cm(2) (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9 to 8.5) and 5.9 kilopond (kp) h/cm(2)\n(95% CI 2.9 to 8.8) between 1% escin and placebo and between 2% escin and placebo\nrespectively. These results were supported by secondary efficacy variables. The\ntime to reach the baseline contralateral tenderness value (resolution of pain) at\nthe injured site was shorter in the treatment groups than in the placebo group\n(p<0.0001). Both active gel preparations produced more rapid pain relief than the\nplacebo gel. No relevant differences were detected between the two active gels.\nThe safety and tolerability of the escin-containing gels were excellent.\nCONCLUSIONS: Escin/diethylammonium salicylate/heparin combination gel\npreparations are effective and safe for the treatment of blunt impact injuries.\n\nPMCID: PMC1724504\nPMID: 12055112  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The role of\nL-DOPA.\n\nMartignoni E(1), Blandini F, Godi L, Desideri S, Pacchetti C, Mancini F, Nappi G.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, Neurological Institute C. \nMondino, University of Pavia, Italy.\n\nOxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease \n(PD). L-DOPA, the gold standard in PD therapy, may paradoxically contribute to\nthe progression of the disease because of its pro-oxidant properties. The issue, \nhowever, is controversial. In this study, we evaluated peripheral markers of\noxidative stress in normal subjects, untreated PD patients and PD patients\ntreated only with L-DOPA. We also measured platelet and plasma levels of L-DOPA, \n3-O-methyldopa (the long-lasting metabolite of the drug), and dopamine. We found \nthat isolated platelets of treated PD patients form higher amounts of\n2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, an index of hydroxyl radical generation, than platelets of\ncontrols or untreated patients. In treated patients, platelet levels of\n2,3-dihydroxybenzoate were positively correlated with platelet levels of L-DOPA, \n3-O-methyldopa, and with the score of disease severity. Disease severity was\ncorrelated with platelet and plasma levels of L-DOPA, as well as with the daily\nintake of the drug. No significant differences in platelet levels of cytosolic\nand mitochondrial isoforms of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase were\nfound between PD patients, either treated or untreated, and controls. Our\nfindings lend further support to the hypothesis that L-DOPA might promote free\nradical formation in PD patients.\n\nPMID: 10468218  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S'\n1. Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 1998 May;54(3):231-5.\n\nSkin and plasma levels of acetylsalicylic acid: a comparison between topical\naspirin/diethyl ether mixture and oral aspirin in acute herpes zoster and\npostherpetic neuralgia.\n\nBareggi SR(1), Pirola R, De Benedittis G.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Milan, Italy.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this investigation was to elucidate whether the analgesic\neffect was due to the local aspirin or to the systemic drug. This was done by\ncomparing skin and plasma levels of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and salicylic acid\n(SA) after topically administered ASA/diethyl ether (ADE) mixture in acute\nherpetic neuralgia (AHN) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The analgesia and the \nplasma and skin levels of ASA were also determined after oral administration of\naspirin.\nMETHODS: Nineteen patients, 11 (57.9%) with AHN and 8 (42.1 %) with PHN were\ngiven, on different days, a single 500-mg oral dose of ASA or a topical dose (750\nmg) of (ADE) daubed onto the painful skin. The analgesic effect was assessed by\nmeans of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Overall pain relief was graded as:\nexcellent, good, fair, or poor. AHN as well as PHN patients had severe pain at\nbaseline (6.83 and 5.93). Levels of ASA and SA in plasma and in the stratum\ncorneum after adhesive tape stripping of the treated area were determined by\nHPLC.\nRESULTS: After ADE application, the analgesic effect was very rapid and VAS\nscores were lower than at baseline. Pain significantly decreased by 82.6% after\ntopical and 15.4% after oral ASA. After ADE, 95% of the patients had excellent or\ngood pain relief, but after oral administration 79% of the patients had a poor\nresponse. Pain relief was similar in the two subgroups after ADE. Skin\nconcentrations of ASA, but not of SA, after ADE were about 80- to 100-fold those \nafter oral administration. Levels of ASA and SA in plasma after oral\nadministration were similar to those previously found, but after ADE were\nundetectable or very low. Patients with excellent pain relief showed a trend\ntowards higher ASA skin concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The analgesic effect can be obtained only after topical\nadministration, because by this route the skin levels of ASA are much higher than\nafter oral administration. The mechanism is exclusively local; there are no\nactive drugs in plasma after topical administration.\n\nPMID: 9681665  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Six volunteers in each group participated in 4\ndifferent placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over studies to measure rapidly\nevolving cutaneous analgesia from topically applied new ointment formulations of \nacetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and salicylic acid (SA) as well as of commercial\nibuprofen and benzocain creams. Similar, log-linear dose-response curves were\nfound for both ASA and SA, significant in effect at 3 g/kg and higher drug\ncontents and reaching saturation level at 15 or 30 g/kg, respectively, which, 20 \nmin after application, caused a mean pain suppression of 95% using ASA and 80%\nusing SA. Half-maximal effects were achieved using 3 g/kg ASA or 15 g/kg SA. The \nSA action was also clearly slower to develop. With an increased flow of the\nacidic buffer, producing lower effective tissue pH and more intense pain, the\neffect of ASA and SA decreased to 73% pain suppression. A competitive mechanism\nof both drug effects was suggested by the fact that, with 15 g/kg ASA and SA,\npain reduction could be reversed by increasing the buffer flow by a factor of\n1.75, on average. Commercial ibuprofen (50 g/kg) and benzocain creams (100 g/kg) \nwere comparably as effective as ASA and SA, but the local anesthetic caused a\nloss of all cutaneous sensations while the touch threshold (von Frey) under the\nspecific analgesics was the same as under the placebo ointment. Thus, topical\napplications of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) dissolved in\ndifferent ointment formulations have proven dose-dependently effective and\nspecific in suppressing experimental acidotic pain by a local and competitive\nmechanism.\n\nPMID: 8867248  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Institute of Physiology, University of Heidelberg, F.R.G.\n\nUsing controlled long lasting noxious squeeze stimuli applied to the interdigital\nwebs we have tried to develop experimental methods allowing us to measure the\neffects of peripherally acting analgesics. In the present double-blind cross-over\nstudy with 12 subjects we tested the effects of aspirin (1000 and 1500 mg) vs.\nplacebo on subjective pain induced by alternately applied 12 N (Newton) and 8 N\nstimuli. During the sessions blood samples were taken in regular intervals to\nmeasure acetylsalicylate (ASA)- and salicylate (SA)-plasma levels. Analyses of\nvariance were computed with several psychophysical parameters. Both the '12 N'\nand the '8 N' ratings discriminated between placebo and aspirin, however, only\nthe ratings obtained from the stronger stimuli discriminated between two doses of\naspirin. Subsequently we computed analyses of covariance with the ASA- and\nSA-plasma levels as covariates. Significant (negative) correlations of pain\nratings and SA-plasma levels were found for the high dose of aspirin, but there\nwere no significant correlations of ASA levels and ratings.\n\nPMID: 3283661  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Twenty-one patients were\ntreated with BCG, and 19 were controls. Eleven patients in each group relapsed\nduring a follow-up period long enough to make it unlikely that further relapses\nwould occur. There were no significant differences in the length of remission or \nthe site of relapse that could be attributed to treatment. Eleven patients died: \nof these none of the six patients in the BCG group but all of the five in the\ncontrol group had stage D lymphomas. BCG treatment increased the rate of recovery\nfrom tumour-induced immunosuppression, but within the BCG group immunocompetence \nimproved most rapidly in the patients who relapsed-a finding that appears to\ncontradict the tenet retionalising the use of immunological adjuvants as\ntreatment.\n\nPMCID: PMC1639074\nPMID: 766905  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S'\n1. Neurol India. 2014 Jan-Feb;62(1):42-7. doi: 10.4103/0028-3886.128280.\n\nSulfasalazine and temozolomide with radiation therapy for newly diagnosed\nglioblastoma.\n\nTakeuchi S(1), Wada K, Nagatani K, Otani N, Osada H, Nawashiro H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Neurosurgery, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki,\nTokorozawa, Saitama 359-8513, Japan.\n\nBACKGROUND: A recent phase 1/2 clinical trial argued for caution for the use of\nsulfasalazine in progressive glioblastoma (GBM). However, the study enrolled\npatients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma indicating that patients\nrecruited probably had severe disease. Thus, the study may not accurately reflect\nthe effectiveness of sulfasalazine for GBM and we hypothesized that earlier\nsulfasalazine administration may lead to anticancer effects.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sulfasalazine can improve\nthe outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed GBM.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients were treated with temozolomide and\nsulfasalazine with radiation therapy after surgery. Twelve patients with primary \nGBM treated with temozolomide and radiation therapy formed the control group.\nProgression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and seizure-free survival \n(SFS) curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. The survival curves\nwere compared using the log-rank test.\nRESULTS: The median OS, PFS and SFS did not differ between the groups. Grade 3 or\n4 adverse events occurred over the duration of the study in nine (75%) patients. \nThe median SFS was 12 months in nine patients who received sulfasalazine\nadministration for more than 21 days, which was strongly but not significantly\nlonger than the 3 months observed in the control group (P = 0.078).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sulfasalazine treatment with temozolomide plus radiotherapy for\nnewly diagnosed primary GBM is associated with a high rate of discontinuation due\nto hematologic toxic effects. This treatment may have no effect on OS or PFS,\nalthough it may improve seizure control if an adequate dose can be administered.\n\nPMID: 24608453  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health. 2003 Dec;50(10):473-6.\n\nTherapeutic effects of fig tree latex on bovine papillomatosis.\n\nHemmatzadeh F(1), Fatemi A, Amini F.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran,\nTehran, Iran. fhemmat@chamran.ut.ac.ir\n\nThe effects of fig tree latex in treating teat papillomatosis in cow in\ncomparison with salicylic acid were evaluated. For this purpose, 12 cows of 1-3\nyears of age (average 2.25) affected by teat papillomatosis were divided into\nthree groups. In group A, four cows were treated by fig tree (Ficus carica)\nlatex; in group B, four cows were treated with 10% salicylic acid solution and in\ngroup C, four cows were kept as control animals receiving no treatment. Animals\nin each treatment group received their treatment once every 5 days. In groups A\nand B, de-epithelialization and shrinking of the warts began from the fifth day\nof treatment and all the warts disappeared within 30 days. However, in the\ncontrol group no changes in the number of warts were observed until day 15 but\nthereafter a number of warts disappeared spontaneously in some of the animals.\nBoth salicylic acid and fig tree latex were evaluated as having similar\ntherapeutic effects in treating teat papillomatosis in cow.\n\nPMID: 14720183  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Br J Dermatol. 2006 Jul;155(1):182-5.\n\nAn evaluation of the efficacy of topical application of salicylic acid for the\ntreatment of familial cylindromatosis.\n\nOosterkamp HM(1), Neering H, Nijman SM, Dirac AM, Mooi WJ, Bernards R,\nBrummelkamp TR.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis and Center for Biomedical Genetics, The\nNetherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nBACKGROUND: Familial cylindromatosis is a rare genetic disorder, giving rise to\nneoplasms of the skin appendages. We have recently shown that loss of the\ncylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene leads to activation of NF-kappaB, a\ntranscription factor having antiapoptotic activity. This provides a possible\nexplanation for the deregulated growth of cylindromas. In cell-based assays,\nsalicylate can prevent NF-kappaB activation caused by loss of the cylindromatosis\ngene, suggesting that salicylic acid application might be a potential treatment\nfor cylindromatosis.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of topical application of salicylic acid \non familial cylindromas.\nMETHODS: Cylindromas in five patients from four different cylindromatosis\nfamilies were treated with twice daily and then once daily topical salicylic\nacid. Clinical response was determined by serial tumour measurements.\nRESULTS: In total 17 cylindromas in five patients were studied: 12 target lesions\nand five control lesions. The median size of the cylindromas was 1.0 cm (range,\n0.6-2.8 cm). Two of the 12 cylindromas showed a complete remission. Another eight\nlesions showed some response, but not sufficient to qualify as partial remission.\nThe control lesions remained stable or increased in size.\nCONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid is a well-tolerated and potential new treatment for\ncylindromatosis.\n\nPMID: 16792771  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Urology. 2005 Feb;65(2):247-50.\n\nApplication of viable bacille Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin topically as a potential\ntherapeutic modality in condylomata acuminata: a placebo-controlled study.\n\nMetawea B(1), El-Nashar AR, Kamel I, Kassem W, Shamloul R.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Andrology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Cairo University\nHospital, Cairo, Egypt.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of topical application of viable bacille\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) as a primary line of treatment in patients with condylomata\nacuminata.\nMETHODS: We recruited 50 patients from the Department of Andrology and Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases, Cairo University Hospital complaining of genital warts.\nPatients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 25 patients who\nreceived BCG as a weekly topical treatment for 6 consecutive weeks. If still\nresistant, another intensive three-times-a-week course for 3 consecutive weeks\nwas given. Group 2 consisted of 25 patients who received 0.9% saline solution as \na placebo solution with the same procedure and follow-up as for group 1. All\npatients were followed up for 6 consecutive months. During the treatment course, \nthe local response, wart state and size, and any side effects were reported.\nRESULTS: A complete response with the disappearance of all condylomata acuminata \nwas achieved in 20 (80%) of the 25 patients after a maximum of six BCG\napplications. Three patients (12%) needed another, more extensive, course,\nresulting in complete clearance 3 weeks later. Only 2 patients (8%) did not\nachieve a full response even after application of the intensified BCG course. No \nresponse was detected in the placebo group, with no improvement during follow-up.\nNo recurrence developed in any responder. Minimal side effects, such as transient\nerythema and fever, were recorded during the study.\nCONCLUSIONS: Topical BCG in the treatment of genital warts attained a high\nsuccess rate in our study compared with the placebo solution, with insignificant \nside effects and no recurrence.\n\nPMID: 15708031  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1984 Jun 15;109(24):935-40.\n\n[Postoperative immunostimulation in non-small-cell bronchial carcinoma. Outcome\nand complications].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nToomes H.\n\nIn two prospective, randomized clinical studies Corynebacterium parvum (C.p.),\nBCG or 0.9% saline solution were injected intrapleurally once between the 6th and\n12th postoperative day in 878 patients with resected, non-oatcell bronchial\ncarcinoma (stage I and II). The rate of complications following C.p.-instillation\n(chest pain, fever) was relatively low compared to partially serious\ncomplications following injection of BCG, especially in patients who underwent\npneumonectomy (21.8% empyema compared to 3.2% in the placebo group). After an\naverage follow-up of 4.6 years in the first study, 110 of 207 C.p.-treated\npatients (53%) were dead compared to 82 of 198 in the placebo group (41%). The\ndifference is statistically significant (P less than 0.02). In the second study, \n79 out of 197 BCG-treated patients (40%) were dead after an average follow-up of \n2.8 years compared to 71 out of 208 placebo-treated patients (34%). This\ndifference is not statistically significant. From these data it is concluded that\npostoperative immunotherapy as performed in these studies is not only of no\nbenefit to the patients, but might even be detrimental as a result of an\nincreased posttherapeutic complication rate and a partially diminished\nexpectation of life.\n\nPMID: 6376041  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Apr;2(4):679-86.\n\nImmunization of melanoma patients with BEC2 anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody\nthat mimics GD3 ganglioside: enhanced immunogenicity when combined with adjuvant.\n\nMcCaffery M(1), Yao TJ, Williams L, Livingston PO, Houghton AN, Chapman PB.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Clinical Immunology Service, Department of Medicine and Department of\nBiostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, \nUSA.\n\nPrevious attempts to immunize melanoma patients against GD3 ganglioside have been\nunsuccessful because of the poor immunogenicity of GD3. BEC2, an anti-idiotypic\nmonoclonal antibody that mimics GD3, can induce anti-GD3 IgG in rabbits. Since\nclinical trials with BEC2 in melanoma patients demonstrated that BEC2 alone is\nnot highly immunogenic, we have carried out sequential clinical trials exploring \nthe use of two immunological adjuvants, BCG and QS21, administered with BEC2.\nMelanoma patients free of disease after surgical resection but at high risk for\nrecurrence were immunized either with BEC2/BCG (14 patients) or BEC2/QS21 (6\npatients). All patients developed high-titer IgG antibodies against BEC2,\ndemonstrating that both adjuvants effectively enhanced the immunogenicity of\nBEC2. Anti-GD3 antibodies were induced in 3 of 14 patients immunized with\nBEC2/BCG; no patient immunized with BEC2/QS21 developed detectable anti-GD3\nantibodies. After a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 71% of the patients immunized \nwith BEC2/BCG remain alive and 64% are free of disease. In patients immunized\nwith BEC2/BCG, no apparent association was observed between class II HLA type and\neither development of anti-GD3 antibodies or survival. We are encouraged by the\nresults with BEC2/BCG, which suggest that further enhancement of the immune\nresponse to BEC2 will result in more frequent anti-GD3 antibody responses among\nimmunized patients.\n\nPMID: 9816218  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Blood. 1994 Sep 15;84(6):1887-95.\n\nSustained high levels of circulating chaperoned interleukin-6 after active\nspecific cancer immunotherapy.\n\nMay LT(1), Patel K, Garc\xc3\xada D, Ndubuisi MI, Ferrone S, Mittelman A, Mackiewicz A, \nSehgal PB.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla\n10595.\n\nIn a phase 1 study of recombinant interleukin-6 (rIL-6) in patients with advanced\nsolid tumors (n = 15), we discovered that the endogenous IL-6 levels, in\npretreatment plasma or serum samples, were distributed into two groups. One set\nof patients (designated "type 1"; n = 9) was characterized by low plasma IL-6\nlevels (48 to 1,700 pg/mL) as measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays\n(ELISA) for IL-6. In the second set of patients (designated "type 2"; n = 6),\nIL-6 ELISAs showed high levels of plasma IL-6 (50 to 600 ng/mL). Neither group\nhad detectable B9 hybridoma cell growth factor activity associated with the IL-6 \nin their pretreatment plasma or serum. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels\nwere markedly elevated in type II patients suggesting that the circulating IL-6\nwas biologically active in vivo. In both groups of patients there was a small but\nsignificant increase in B9 activity in the plasma within three hours after rIL-6 \nadministration (n = 5). Gel filtration profiles showed that circulating IL-6 in\ntype 1 patients, 15 to 120 minutes after rIL-6 administration was of approximate \nmass 20 to 40 kD, whereas in type 2 patients, the IL-6 before and after exogenous\nrIL-6 administration was indistinguishable and was of an approximate mass of 200 \nkD. IL-6 immunoaffinity purification of the 200 kD complexes showed these to\ncontain multiple isoforms of IL-6 (14 to 31 kD) and the soluble IL-6 receptor\n(sIL-6R; 50 to 55 kD). A distinguishing clinical history was that all of the type\n2 patients had been actively immunized with an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody\n(MoAb) (MK2-23) 3 to 12 months before initiation of this study for advanced\nmelanoma. An analysis of the plasma IL-6 content in other melanoma patients (n = \n16) during antiidiotypic MoAb immunization indicated that marked (up to 600\nng/mL) and sustained (several months) elevations of circulating "chaperoned" IL-6\nwere induced by active immunization regimens.\n\nPMID: 8080995  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

So far, no significant\ndifferences between the groups are evident. In stage III melanoma, a series of\nnew agents are being rapidly screened and some appear promising. A closer look at\nthe basic immunopathologic process during the growth of melanomas is might lead\nto a more effective control of this malignancy.\n\nPMID: 7036291  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Patients were randomly allocated to receive no immunotherapy or\nimmunotherapy consisting of methanol extracted residue of bacillus\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (0.5 mg intradermally; 100 microgram in five separate sites)\nevery 5 weeks, concomitant with chemotherapy. Of these 28 evaluable patients, 13 \nreceived chemoimmunotherapy with one complete response (CR) and 15 received\nchemotherapy alone with one CR. Both responses occurred in lymph node metastases.\nNo partial responses were seen.\n\nPMID: 356970  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Dev Biol Stand. 1977 Apr 13-15;38:567-72.\n\nClinical immunotherapy experiences in the Southeastern Cancer Study Group.\n\nGordon DS.\n\nThe Southeastern Cancer Study Group has been particularly interested in the use\nof immunological adjuvants in the treatment of melanoma and acute myelogenous\nleukemia. A study of chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy in randomly selected \npatients with metastatic malignant melanoma revealed no significant increase in\neither complete remissions or overall survival in the group receiving\nchemoimmunotherapy. Preliminary results in a study involving maintenance of\npatients with acute myelogenous leukemia (chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy)\nrevealed suggestive but not statistically significant increases in remission\nduration and survival in the group receiving immunotherapy. Data from these\nongoing studies and plans for new group studies are presented in this paper.\n\nPMID: 344110  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1976 Nov;44:85-6.\n\nImmunotherapy in malignant melanomaa.\n\nHomes EC, Morton DL, Eilber FR, Golub SE, Sulit HL.\n\nAccumlated evidence suggests that human neoplasms contain antigens that elicit\nhumoral and cellular immunity in the immunocompetent host. A recent summary\nreport showed that Stage II melanoma patients with metastases to regional lymph\nnodes had a lowered incidence of recurrence and a higher incidence of survival\nfollowing surgery and postoperative BCG immunotherapy. To verify these findings, \nclinical trials are now under way in which we radomized melanoma patients into\ngroups to compare treatment by surgery alone with surgery and BCG only, or\nsurgery and BCG in combination with allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine. Serum\nsamples from each patient are monitored by in vitro techniques to define those\nmethods which best correlate to clinical course. Hopefully, such correlations can\nbe used to monitor response to immunotherapy before disease is clinically\napparent. Although immunotherapy does not cause regression of far advanced\ndisease, it undoubtedly will be beneficial against subclinical, microscopic\ntumor.\n\nPMID: 799763  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, the study enrolled\npatients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma indicating that patients\nrecruited probably had severe disease. Thus, the study may not accurately reflect\nthe effectiveness of sulfasalazine for GBM and we hypothesized that earlier\nsulfasalazine administration may lead to anticancer effects.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sulfasalazine can improve\nthe outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed GBM.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients were treated with temozolomide and\nsulfasalazine with radiation therapy after surgery. Twelve patients with primary \nGBM treated with temozolomide and radiation therapy formed the control group.\nProgression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and seizure-free survival \n(SFS) curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. The survival curves\nwere compared using the log-rank test.\nRESULTS: The median OS, PFS and SFS did not differ between the groups. Grade 3 or\n4 adverse events occurred over the duration of the study in nine (75%) patients. \nThe median SFS was 12 months in nine patients who received sulfasalazine\nadministration for more than 21 days, which was strongly but not significantly\nlonger than the 3 months observed in the control group (P = 0.078).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sulfasalazine treatment with temozolomide plus radiotherapy for\nnewly diagnosed primary GBM is associated with a high rate of discontinuation due\nto hematologic toxic effects. This treatment may have no effect on OS or PFS,\nalthough it may improve seizure control if an adequate dose can be administered.\n\nPMID: 24608453  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, it has not been used\nglobally. In the present study, we compared the timing of onset of efficacy and\nthe usefulness of this drug with that of the globally accepted agent\nsalazosulfapyridine (SASP). There were 26 patients in the Buc group and 23 in the\nSASP group. We compared changes in the number of swollen joints, number of\npainful joints, duration of morning stiffness, grip strength, levels of\ninflammatory marker [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein \n(CRP)], rheumatoid factor (RF), physician's rating by visual analogue scale\n(VAS), patient's rating of pain, patient's overall rating (VAS), and improvement \naccording to European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria (DAS28-CRP,\nDAS28-ESR) in these two groups of patients. Both Buc and SASP were shown to be\nefficacious within 3 months after the start of treatment. Both drugs were found\nto be suitable as first-line treatment of early RA. Signs of efficacy tended to\noccur earlier with Buc than with SASP, and Buc also tended to have higher\nefficacy than SASP.\n\nPMID: 19363607  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

However, direct comparison of this drug with \nstandard DMARDs including sulfasalazine (SASP) and methotrexate (MTX) has been\nscarcely reported. We therefore tried to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Buc by\nanalyzing the database from the long-term observational cohort study IORRA\n(previously known as J-ARAMIS). The cross-sectional analysis revealed that\nresponses to Buc treatment were better in males, patients with shorter duration\nof illness, and those who were rheumatoid factor-negative. In the longitudinal\nanalysis, although there was no marked difference among the baseline variables of\npatients with Buc, SASP, and MTX, the percentage of patients exhibiting moderate \nor good response to treatment, as rated using the European League Against\nRheumatism improvement criteria, was higher in the Buc group (41.0%) than in the \nMTX (32.6%) and SASP groups (25.6%). These data support Buc as a candidate for\nbeing a first-line drug for the treatment of patients with RA.\n\nPMID: 17165000  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Results\nwere evaluated on the basis of the duration of treatment for each drug with\ninefficacy or inadequate efficacy as one endpoint for discontinuation and adverse\ndrug reactions (ADRs) as the other in single agent and combination therapy. The\nincidence and nature of ADRs in single and combination treatment are described.\nRESULTS: The effects of MTX, SSZ and BUC on clinical parameters were monitored\nover the first three months, and in particular, NPJs and NSJs were found to\ndecrease significantly during single agent MTX or BUC treatment over 108 months. \nCRP levels remained significantly improved for more than 120 months with MTX. In \nthe single and combination long-term treatments, continuation rate with\ninefficacy or inadequate efficacy as the end point achieved for each of the\ntreatments were 83.1% for MTX, 76.0% for BUC, 68.5% for SSZ, and in the case of\nthe combination treatments, these rates were 83.3% for MTX + BUC and 71.0% for\nMTX+SSZ. Continuation rates using ADRs as the end point were 88% for SSZ, 79.6%\nfor BUC and 79.4% for MTX. The incidences of ADRs for the various treatments\nwere: MTX 22.2%, SSZ 11.0%, BUC 20.6%, MTX + BUC 30.0% and MTX + SSZ 31.2%.\nCONCLUSION: MTX showed the highest efficacy even though it was administrated at a\nlow dose (6-8 mg), as a single agent or in combination with other treatment.\nHowever, in combination treatments, the continuous duration of treatment ending\nin ADRs as the end point were lower than those in single treatments with MTX, SSZ\nand BUC.\n\nPMID: 16870092  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The primary outcome variable was the change in\nBASDAI over 6 months. Secondary outcomes included measures of spinal pain,\nphysical function and inflammation.\nRESULTS: 230 patients (50% men, age range 18-64 years, 67% human leucocyte\nantigen B27 positive) were treated with either SSZ 2x1 g/day or placebo for 6\nmonths. Enthesitis was found in 50%, and peripheral arthritis in 47% of the\npatients. The mean (SD) BASDAI dropped markedly in both groups: by 3.7 (2.7) and \n3.8 (2.4), respectively, as did most secondary outcome measures. No noticeable\ndifference in treatment was observed between groups. Patients with IBP and no\nperipheral arthritis had significantly (p = 0.03) more benefit with SSZ (BASDAI\n5.1 (1.3) to 2.8 (2.3)) than with placebo (5.2 (1.6) to 3.8 (2.4)). Spinal pain\n(p = 0.03) and morning stiffness (p = 0.05) improved with SSZ in these patients, \nbut other secondary outcomes were not markedly different.\nCONCLUSION: SSZ was no better than placebo for the treatment of the signs and\nsymptoms of uSpA; however, SSZ was more effective than placebo in the subgroup of\npatients with IBP and no peripheral arthritis.\n\nPMCID: PMC1798286\nPMID: 16606646  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

BMC Cancer. 2006 Jan 31;6:29.\n\nA phase 1-2, prospective, double blind, randomized study of the safety and\nefficacy of Sulfasalazine for the treatment of progressing malignant gliomas:\nstudy protocol of [ISRCTN45828668].\n\nRobe PA(1), Martin D, Albert A, Deprez M, Chariot A, Bours V.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Neurosurgery, University of Li\xc3\xa8ge, Domaine du Sart TIlman, B35,\n4000 Li\xc3\xa8ge, Belgium. pierre.robe@ulg.ac.be\n\nBACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients suffering from WHO grade 3 and 4 astrocytic\nglioma remains poor despite surgery, radiation therapy and the use of current\nchemotherapy regimen. Indeed, the median survival of glioblastoma multiforme (WHO\ngrade 4) patients is at best 14.6 month with only 26.5 percent of the patients\nstill alive after 2 years and the median survival of anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO\ngrade 3) is 19.2 month. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor\nNF-kappaB is constitutively expressed in malignant gliomas and that its\ninhibition by drugs like Sulfasalazine may block the growth of astrocytic tumors \nin vitro and in experimental models of malignant gliomas.\nDESIGN: ULg_GBM_04/1 is a prospective, randomized, double blind single-center\nphase 1-2 study. A total of twenty patients with progressive malignant glioma\ndespite surgery, radiation therapy and a first line of chemotherapy will be\nrecruited and assigned to four dosage regimen of Sulfasalazine. This medication\nwill be taken orally t.i.d. at a daily dose of 1.5-3-4 or 6 g, continuously until\ncomplete remission, evidence of progression or drug intolerance. Primary\nendpoints are drug safety in the setting of malignant gliomas and tumor response \nas measured according to MacDonald's criteria. An interim analysis of drug safety\nwill be conducted after the inclusion of ten patients. The complete evaluation of\nprimary endpoints will be conducted two years after the enrollment of the last\npatient or after the death of the last patient should this occur prematurely.\nDISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of\nSulfasalazine as a treatment for recurring malignant gliomas. The safety and\nefficacy of this drug are analyzed as primary endpoints. Overall survival and\nprogression-free survival are secondary endpoint.\n\nPMCID: PMC1368982\nPMID: 16448552  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Rheumatology (Oxford). 2002 Aug;41(8):892-8.\n\nAnalysis of improvements, full responses, remission and toxicity in rheumatoid\npatients treated with step-up combination therapy (methotrexate, cyclosporin A,\nsulphasalazine) or monotherapy for three years.\n\nFerraccioli GF(1), Gremese E, Tomietto P, Favret G, Damato R, Di Poi E.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine,\nDPMSC, University of Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate two monotherapies followed by step-up combination therapy \nwith two or three complementary drugs in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in\ncomparison with sulphasalazine (SSZ) alone.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients with early active RA\nwere enrolled in this open controlled clinical trial. The primary end-point was\n50% improvement according to the ACR criteria (ACR50) at 6, 12 or 18 months. The \nsecondary end-points were a full response (Magnusson criteria) and/or remission\n(ACR criteria) at 3 yr. Methotrexate (MTX) (group 1), cyclosporin A (CsA) (group \n2) or SSZ (group 3) was used first. After 6 months, a combination of two drugs\n(CsA and MTX) was employed in groups 1 and 2. SSZ was added after 12 months if\nimprovement was less than ACR50 with the combination. Group 3 continued with SSZ \nalone.\nRESULTS: After 6 months, 57% of patients in group 1, 31% of group 2 (MTX vs CsA, \nP=0.002) and 33% of group 3 (MTX vs SSZ, P=0.01) had reached ACR50 improvement\naccording to intention-to-treat analysis. At month 12 after starting a drug\ncombination, 67% of group 1 and 76% of group 2 had reached ACR50 compared with\n24% of group 3. At the 18-month follow-up, 90% of group 1 and 88% of group 2 but \nonly 24% of group 3 had reached ACR50. After 18 months, 62% of group 1, 60% of\ngroup 2 and 48% of group 3 showed side-effects and three, five and eight patients\nin the three groups respectively had dropped out of the study. At the 3-yr\nfollow-up, 9% of the patients in groups 1 and 2 and 7% of group 3 were in\nremission according to the ACR criteria; according to the Magnusson criteria, 40%\nshowed a full response in groups 1 and 2 but only 21% did so in group 3.\nCONCLUSION: MTX appears to be the fastest-acting agent. A step-up approach with\nMTX plus CsA plus SSZ led to a 50% improvement according to the ACR criteria in\nmost patients. After 3 yr, 40% of patients receiving combination therapy and 21% \nof patients receiving monotherapy showed a full response, while 9 and 7%\nrespectively attained remission.\n\nPMID: 12154206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Roentgenographic\nevaluation was often normal at the beginning of the disease or showed nonspecific\nbone reactions. Radioisotope bone scans assisted in establishing the diagnosis\nand in identifying lesions that were initially clinically silent. Bone biopsies\nwere performed in seven cases. Histopathological examination showed only mild\ninflammatory nonspecific changes. Microbiological cultures were always negative. \nTreatments were different according to the evolution of the disease and the\nhospital. There was no response to antibiotics in seven patients. The response to\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and steroids was moderate and often\ntransient. Salazopyrine and pamidronate treatment used in two patients allowed a \ndurable remission. We lost sight of four patients, pain persisted in three in\nspite of treatment, it disappeared in two with treatment, mild pain persisted in \nfive without treatment and remission occurred in three without treatment.\nCONCLUSION: This study clarifies the clinical and radiologic features of chronic \nrecurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. The recognition of this rare entity is often \ndelayed and difficulties in patient management sometimes emerge from its usual\nprotracted course.\n\nPMID: 11446177  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of\neither EULAR good responders 34%, 38%, 38% or ACR criteria responders 59%, 59%,\n65% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively. Radiological progression\nevaluated by the modified Sharp score was very modest in the three groups: mean\nchanges in erosion score: +2.4, +2.4, +1.9, in narrowing score: +2.3, +2.1, +1.6 \nand in total damage score: +4.6, +4.5, +3.5, in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX\ngroups respectively. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SASP + MTX\ngroup 91% versus 75% in the SASP and MTX group (p = 0.025). Nausea was the most\nfrequent side effect: 32%, 23%, 49% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups\nrespectively (p = 0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that an early initiation therapy of disease\nmodifying drug seems to be of benefit. However, this study was unable to\ndemonstrate a clinically relevant superiority of the combination therapy although\nseveral outcomes were in favour of this observation. The tolerability of the\nthree treatment modalities seems acceptable.\n\nPMCID: PMC1752864\nPMID: 10364900  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

MRI studies were performed at\n6-month intervals on a subset of 89 patients.\nRESULTS: Sulfasalazine failed to slow or prevent disability progression as\nmeasured by the primary outcome (confirmed worsening of the Expanded Disability\nStatus Scale [EDSS] score by at least 1.0 point on two consecutive 3-month\nvisits). Sulfasalazine influenced favorably a number of secondary outcomes during\nthe first 18 months of the trial (e.g., annualized relapse rate, proportion of\nrelapse-free patients; progressive subgroup only: rate of EDSS progression at 1\nand 2 years, median time to EDSS progression) but these positive findings were\nnot sustained into the second half of the trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sulfasalazine does not prevent EDSS score progression in the subset \nof MS patients studied by this protocol. Treatments may improve relapse-related\noutcomes in MS, at least temporarily, without providing sustained slowing of EDSS\nprogression. Phase III MS trials should be of sufficient length to determine a\nmeaningful impact on disease course.\n\nPMID: 9818858  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A randomised\ndouble blind placebo controlled trial.\n\nEgsmose C(1), Hansen TM, Andersen LS, Beier JM, Christensen L, Ejstrup L, Peters \nND, van der Heijde DM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, Copenhagen Municipal Hospital, Denmark.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sulphasalazine in reactive\narthritis.\nMETHODS: Double blind placebo controlled trial of six months duration comparing\nsulphasalazine 2-3 g per day (n = 37) with matching placebo (n = 42) in adults\nwith active reactive arthritis (age 19-57 years, median 34). Treatment response\nwas evaluated once a month by changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),\npain, peripheral arthritis, tender iliosacral joints, entesopathy,\nextra-articular manifestations, and working ability.\nRESULTS: 15 patients in the sulphasalazine group and eight in the placebo group\nwithdrew from the study prematurely. Adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal, \nwere the main reason for withdrawal in the actively treated group.\nIntention-to-treat analyses showed significant improvements over time in both\ngroups in ESR, pain, and number of swollen joints (P < 0.01). Number of days on\nsick leave decreased significantly in the sulphasalazine group only (P < 0.01).\nNo significant differences between the two groups were present after six months. \nAmong the patients completing the trial according to protocol, persistent\ncomplete remission had occurred within two months in five (23%) of the actively\ntreated, but in no placebo treated patients (P = 0.013).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sulphasalazine seemed to improve only the very short term outcome of\nreactive arthritis. The possible beneficial effect of the drug should also be\nweighed against the risk of adverse events. Although these were mainly mild,\nalmost 25% of the patients in the actively treated group gave up treatment for\nthis reason.\n\nPMCID: PMC1752243\nPMID: 9059138  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Motor disability grades were improved by\nmore than one grade in 69.5% (91/131) of patients by oral administration of\nprednisolone, 50% (3/6) by eperisone hydrochloride only, 43.8% (7/16) by blood\npurification (lymphocytapheresis and plasmapheresis), 40.0% (2/5) by intrathecal \ninjection of hydrocortisone, 30.0% (3/10) by intravenous injection of high-dose\nmethylprednisolone, 23.3% (10/43) by interferon-alpha (intramuscular injection\nand inhalation), 22.2% (2/9) by azathioprine, 20.0% (4/20) by high-dose vitamin\nC, 16.0% (4/25) by erythromycin, 12.5% (3/24) by salazosulfapyridine, 11.8%\n(2/17) by mizoribine, 7.1% (1/14) by fosfomycin, and 6.3% (1/16) by thyrotropin\nreleasing hormone. No critical side effects of these therapies were seen with the\nexceptions of one patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome due to\ncytomegalovirus infection and one patient with drug-induced hepatitis/hepatic\nfailure. Selection of these treatments for patients with HAM/ TSP must be\nconsidered on the basis of age, sex, disease severity and complications to reduce\nadverse events and to improve quality of life. Although the results were a\nsynopsis of different treatments given to 200 patients with HAM/ TSP as an open\ntrial, we consider this the first report of a large-scale therapeutic trial in\npatients with HAM/TSP. The results of this study indicate that immunomodulatory\ntherapies have some beneficial effects in HAM/TSP, and the functions of these\nagents are related to the pathophysiology of this disease.\n\nPMID: 8912211  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A\nrandomized, controlled study.\n\nTaggart A(1), Gardiner P, McEvoy F, Hopkins R, Bird H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland,\nUK.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of sulfasalazine (SSZ) with its two moieties, \n5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) and sulfapyridine (SP), in patients with active\nankylosing spondylitis (AS).\nMETHODS: A 26-week randomized, observer-blinded, 2-center, controlled study of\ntreatment with either SSZ, ASA, or SP was conducted in 90 patients with active\nAS. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at monthly intervals, using several\nclinical and laboratory measures of disease activity. A global assessment of\ntreatment efficacy was made by both patients and observers at the end of the\nstudy period.\nRESULTS: There were no significant changes in any of the parameters of disease\nactivity in the ASA treatment group. Levels of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM fell\nsignificantly during treatment with SP, but none of the other changes reached\nstatistical significance. Plasma viscosity and IgG and IgA levels fell\nsignificantly during treatment with SSZ, as did nocturnal spinal pain and overall\nspinal pain. Patients and observers reported a favorable outcome after treatment \nwith SSZ or SP significantly more often than with ASA treatment.\nCONCLUSION: SP appears to be the active moiety in AS, although there was a trend \nsuggesting a better outcome in the SSZ group compared with the SP group, perhaps \nsuggesting the importance of a common sulfonamide structure for efficacy.\n\nPMID: 8702450  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The effectiveness of sulfasalazine in AS still \nlacks strong evidence, as well, the magnitude of its benefit is unknown. A\nmeta-analysis was carried out to assess the effectiveness of sulfasalazine in AS.\nA search of the literature was done using Medline, Index Medicus, the reference\nlists of articles located and contacting content experts to reveal unpublished\nstudies. Five randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing sulfasalazine to\nplacebo were located and assessed methodologically. The methodologic quality of\nall 5 RCT was considered satisfactory and consequently these studies were\nincluded in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of clinical benefit (and its\n95% confidence interval) favoring sulfasalazine, over and above that observed in \nthe placebo group was as follows: Duration of morning stiffness -28.2% (-54.6 to \n-1.8%); severity of morning stiffness -30.6% (-52.5 to -8.7%); severity of pain\n-26.7% (-44.3 to -9.1%); general well being -7.1% (-24.3 to 10.0%); erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate -9.2% (-24.8 to 6.4%); and IgA -11.7% (-18.8 to -4.7%).\nAdverse effects, mostly mild, were more frequently observed in the sulfasalazine \ngroup (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5746, p = 0.1082). The occurrence of dropouts (OR =\n1.1554, p = 0.6119) was similar in both groups.

An earlier open study suggested that it was\nwell tolerated and potentially beneficial. The present double-blind\nplacebo-controlled trial of 30 patients has now confirmed its efficacy. Greater\nimprovement occurred in those patients on active treatment than on placebo, with \nmore benefit being detected in those patients with the symmetrical polyarticular \nbut seronegative pattern of arthritis associated with a high acute-phase\nresponse. SASP was stopped in 26% because of side-effects but these were mild. No\nexacerbation or remission of psoriasis was observed. Further studies are in\nprogress to determine the degree of efficacy of SASP in different clinical\nsubgroups of psoriatic arthritis.\n\nPMID: 1968355  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Br J Rheumatol. 1990 Feb;29(1):41-5.\n\nA controlled trial of sulphasalazine treatment of chronic ankylosing spondylitis:\nfailure to demonstrate a clinical effect.\n\nCorkill MM(1), Jobanputra P, Gibson T, Macfarlane DG.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Rheumatology Unit, Guy's Hospital, London.\n\nComment in\n    Br J Rheumatol. 1990 Feb;29(1):2-3.\n\nSixty-two patients with long established but symptomatic ankylosing spondylitis\nwere treated with sulphasalazine or matching placebo in a randomized double-blind\ncontrolled trial for 48 weeks. There were no consistent significant differences\nbetween the treatment groups in clinical parameters despite multiple assessments.\nEquivalent numbers in each group were able to decrease or stop non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drug ingestion during the study period (four active, eight\nplacebo). Side effects were reported more commonly in the sulphasalazine group\n(27 versus 17, NS), but only 21 patients stopped treatment because of side\neffects (12 versus 9, NS). Analysis of the subgroup with an initial ESR greater\nthan 20 mm/h failed to show any persisting differences of response between\nsulphasalazine and placebo. We conclude that sulphasalazine therapy does not have\na role in the treatment of chronic ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nPMID: 1968354  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Arthritis Rheum. 1988 Jun;31(6):702-13.\n\nA controlled trial comparing sulfasalazine, gold sodium thiomalate, and placebo\nin rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nWilliams HJ(1), Ward JR, Dahl SL, Clegg DO, Willkens RF, Oglesby T, Weisman MH,\nSchlegel S, Michaels RM, Luggen ME, et al.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City 84132.\n\nOne hundred eight-six patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were evaluated in\na double-blind, randomized study that compared treatment with sulfasalazine (SSZ)\n(2 mg/day), gold sodium thiomalate (GST) (50 mg/week), and placebo (PBO). The\n37-week course of therapy was completed by 109 patients. While marked improvement\nwas seen in all 3 treatment groups, the only statistically significant\ndifferences between SSZ or GST and PBO were in a decreased erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate and increased grip strength in the right hand. GST is known to\nbe superior to PBO, and the response of the GST-treated group was similar to that\nseen in other trials. The response of the PBO group, however, was much greater\nthan in other placebo groups we have studied. SSZ was similar in efficacy to\ninjectable gold, but was better tolerated. Because of adverse drug reactions\n(most commonly, rash, stomatitis, and proteinuria), 41% of patients were\nwithdrawn from the GST treatment. Untoward drug effects (most frequently, rash\nand gastrointestinal distress) caused 16% of patients to be withdrawn from SSZ\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 2898244  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Gut. 1973 Dec;14(12):923-6.\n\nA controlled therapeutic trial of long-term maintenance treatment of ulcerative\ncolitis with sulphazalazine (Salazopyrin).\n\nDissanayake AS, Truelove SC.\n\nSixty-four patients with proven ulcerative colitis who had been maintained on\nsulphasalazine as their sole form of treatment for a minimum period of one year\nwere entered into a controlled trial of sulphasalazine versus dummy tablets for a\nperiod of six months. All the patients admitted were not only symptom-free but\nalso showed no evidence of inflammation on sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy. A\npatient was judged to have relapsed when there was a recurrence of colitic\nsymptoms accompanied by sigmoidoscopic and histological evidence of inflammation.\nThe patients who received dummy tablets had more than four times the relapse rate\nof those receiving sulphasalazine. The results were similar in patients who had\nbeen on maintenance treatment with sulphasalazine for less than three years\nbefore entry into the trial and in those who had been on this treatment for more \nthan three years. It is concluded that maintenance treatment of ulcerative\ncolitis with sulphasalazine should be continued indefinitely unless\ncontraindicated by side effects.\n\nPMCID: PMC1412871\nPMID: 4150435  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Br Heart J. 1995 Mar;73(3):227-36.\n\nCombining salicylate and enalapril in patients with coronary artery disease and\nheart failure.\n\nBaur LH(1), Schipperheyn JJ, van der Laarse A, Souverijn JH, Fr\xc3\xb6lich M, de Groot \nA, Voogd PJ, Vroom TF, Cats VM, Keirse MJ, et al.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Cardiology, University Hospital, Leiden, The Netherlands.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To study the effects of adding a salicylate to the angiotensin\nconverting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in patients with heart failure due to\ncoronary artery disease.\nDESIGN: Double blind, crossover study for three days in hospital followed by an\nextended similar study outside hospital over two months of once daily enalapril\nplus salicylate and enalapril plus placebo.\nSETTING: Tertiary referral centre.\nPATIENTS: 20 patients with heart failure due to myocardial infarction (New York\nHeart Association class II or III) and an ejection fraction less than 0.40.\nTwelve patients completed the two parts of the study.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure, plasma converting enzyme activity; plasma \nangiotensin II and noradrenaline concentrations; excretion of metabolites of\nrenal and systemic prostanoids.\nRESULTS: The unloading effect of first and second dose of enalapril in the\nmorning lasted only during the day; in the extended study it lasted 24 hours\nbecause of the drug's accumulation. Converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate the\nbreakdown of bradykinin and therefore enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis mediated\nby bradykinin. Evidence was found of such a prostaglandin E2 mediated\ncontribution to ventricular unloading by enalapril, which was blocked by\nsalicylate. The contribution, however, was small and variable, and salicylate\naddition had on average no significant de-unloading effect during the day.\nUnloading was abolished in only three of the 20 patients in the short term study \nand in one of the 12 in the extended study. At night, when other effects of\nenalapril on blood pressure had waned and the bradykinin induced effect\npersisted, salicylate significantly reduced the remaining small unloading effect.\nNo effect was seen of salicylate addition on reversal of remodelling. Enalapril\nreduced angiotensin II induced synthesis of systemic and renal prostaglandin I2\nand thromboxane A2, initially only during the day, but later also at night. It\nthereby masked suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis by salicylate, which is\nthe effect to which reinfarct prevention by salicylate is attributed.\nCONCLUSION: The risk is low that salicylate will substantially reduce the benefit\nof enalapril in patients with heart failure by de-unloading the ventricle. Like\nother effects induced by bradykinin significant de-unloading occurs in only a\nminority of the patients. In the presence of enalapril, however, salicylate will \nprobably not be as effective as expected in reducing reinfarction risk, because\nenalapril already reduces thromboxane A2 synthesis effectively in patients with\nheart failure and no further reduction by salicylate was found.\n\nPMCID: PMC483803\nPMID: 7727181  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2011 Dec\n9.\n\nPhase I trial of sodium salicylate in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and\nacute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nKlimek VM(1), Dolezal EK, Smith L, Soff G, Nimer SD.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,\n1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA. Klimekv@mskcc.org\n\nSodium salicylate is an inexpensive, readily available anti-inflammatory agent\nwhich inhibits NF-\xce\xbaB in in vitro models. We examined whether it was possible to\nsafely achieve and maintain salicylate levels known to inhibit NF-\xce\xbaB in vitro in \n11 patients with MDS or AML taking sodium salicylate. Most patients achieved the \ntarget blood salicylate level (20-30mg/dL) with acceptable toxicity, including\nreversible grade 1/2 elevations of hepatic transaminases (n=4) and ototoxicity\n(n=4). One patient had grade 3/4 elevations in AST/ALT. This study suggests that \nsodium salicylate may be safely combined with conventional chemotherapy regimens \nwhich are not associated with significant ototoxicity or hepatotoxicity.\n\nCopyright \xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

S'\n1. J Neurooncol. 1996 Feb;27(2):179-89.\n\nAutologous tumor cell vaccination combined with adoptive cellular immunotherapy\nin patients with grade III/IV astrocytoma.\n\nHolladay FP(1), Heitz-Turner T, Bayer WL, Wood GW.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Neurosurgery Division, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, 66160,\nUSA\n\nBrain tumors are highly resistant to treatment. Their diffuse infiltrative nature\nand the relative inaccessibility of the brain to blood and lymph are barriers to \nsurgical and cytotoxic treatments alike. Preclinical animal studies demonstrated \nthat intravenously administered tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes will reject \ntumors growing in the brain. Specifically activated effector T lymphocytes may be\ngenerated by in vivo immunization followed by restimulation of antigen-primed T\ncells with autologous tumor cells in vitro. In order to apply these findings to\nhumans, feasibility studies of combined active immunization and specific adoptive\ncellular immunotherapy were performed on fifteen patients with recurrent\nastrocytoma. The objective was to determine whether; 1) T cells could be grown\nfrom peripheral blood of patients immunized with autologous tumor cells, and 2)\nwhether stimulated cells could be safely readministered to patients. Patients\nwere immunized with a combination of their own irradiated tumor cells and\nBacillus of Calmette and Guerin. Two weeks later a mononuclear cell-rich fraction\nof blood was obtained by leukapheresis. Mononuclear cells were cultured with\nirradiated autologous tumor cells and interleukin-2. Selective expansion of CD4+ \nand CD8+ T lymphocytes occurred. Intravenous transfer of stimulated cells to the \nfifteen patients on twenty-four separate occasions with or without systemic\nadministration of interleukin-2 was tolerated with limited toxicity. The studies \nestablished the feasibility of conducting controlled studies of the anti-tumor\neffects of tumor antigen-specific cellular immunotherapy.\n\nPMID: 8699241  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub\n2012 Aug 7.\n\nEtanercept normalises left ventricular mass in patients with rheumatoid\narthritis.\n\nDa\xc3\xafen CI(1), Fesler P, du Cailar G, Da\xc3\xafen V, Mura T, Dupuy AM, Cristol JP,\nRibstein J, Combe B, Morel J.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, University Montpellier I, Lapeyronie Hospital,\nMontpellier, France.\n\nBACKGROUND: Cardiovascular mortality is increased in patients with rheumatoid\narthritis (RA). RA is associated with an increased left ventricular mass index\n(LVMI), a strong marker of cardiovascular mortality, and vessel abnormalities.\nExperimental studies have suggested that tumour necrosis factor \xce\xb1 (TNF\xce\xb1) may\ninduce LV hypertrophy.\nOBJECTIVE: To study the effect of medium-term (3- and 6-months) treatment with\nthe TNF\xce\xb1 inhibitor etanercept (ETN) and synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs (sDMARDs) on LV morphological features and arterial stiffness in patients\nwith RA.\nMETHODS: Consecutive female patients with active RA requiring treatment with ETN \n(n=28) or sDMARDs (n=20) were included. Clinical and biological monitoring,\nechocardiography and pulse wave velocity (PWV) assessment were performed at\ninclusion and at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Paired t tests and \nmultivariate linear regression analysis were used.\nRESULTS: Mean LVMI tended to be higher at baseline in the ETN group than in the\nsDMARD group (96.5\xc2\xb119.8 vs 84.3\xc2\xb126.8 g/m2; p=0.11 for the ETN and sDMARD groups, \nrespectively). In patients with ETN treatment, mean LVMI was significantly\ndecreased at 3 and 6 months (-6.3\xc2\xb17.6 and -14.2\xc2\xb19.3 g/m2; p<0.001), with no\nchange from baseline for patients with sDMARD treatment (-2.2\xc2\xb110.9 and -2.7\xc2\xb110.2 \ng/m2, respectively). Blood pressure (BP) and aortic PWV were not changed by\neither treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: ETN induced a significant decrease in LVMI with medium-term\ntreatment with no change in BP or PWV. TNF\xce\xb1 may be an important factor of LV\nhypertrophy, which may explain the benefit of TNF inhibitors on cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality in RA. These results need to be confirmed by larger\nstudies and with other TNF inhibitors.\n\nPMID: 22872022  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In experimental studies, activation of the inflammatory\nregulator, nuclear factor kappa B (NFlB), contributes to endothelial activation\nand reduced nitric oxide production. We treated patients with coronary artery\ndisease with sulfasalazine, an inhibitor of NF\xce\xbaB, and placebo in a randomized,\ndouble-blind, crossover study design. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation\n(FMD) and digital vascular function were measured at baseline and after each\n6-week treatment period. Of the 53 patients enrolled in the crossover study, 32\n(age 60 \xc2\xb1 10, 22% female) completed all the visits, with a high rate of study\nwithdrawal due to gastrointestinal side effects. In a subset of 10 participants, \nwe compared the effects of 4 days of sulfasalazine treatment (n = 5) to no\ntreatment (n = 5) on NF\xce\xbaB-regulated gene expression in peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells. Tumor necrosis factor \xce\xb1-stimulated expression of CD69 and NFlB\nsubunit p50 was significantly blunted after 4 days of sulfasalazine treatment but\nnot after no treatment. However, FMD and digital vasodilator response did not\nsignificantly change from baseline with long-term sulfasalazine treatment.\nShort-term sulfasalazine inhibited NFlB activity; however, long-term treatment\nwas poorly tolerated and did not improve endothelial function. Our findings\nsuggest that sulfasalazine therapy is not the optimal anti-inflammatory treatment\nfor reversing endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease. Further studies \nare warranted to investigate the potential for NFlB inhibition to reduce\ncardiovascular risk.\n\nPMCID: PMC3632403\nPMID: 22496207  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The disease affects all organs of the body concurrently or\nconsecutively. Its various clinical manifestations result from ubiquitous\nsmall-vessel vasculitis, which is the underlying pathology. An Italian study has \nreported an increased association of the extended haplotype B51-DR5-DQw3. Without\na known etiology BD syndrome has no uniformly acceptable therapy. Our study\naddresses therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of BD, with the systemic use\nof interferon alpha-2a., which has antiviral. immunomodulatory,\nantiproliferative, and antitumoral properties. Ten patients diagnosed with BD\nwere referred from September 2002 to September 2005 to the Department of\nGynaecology, Obstetrics and Reproduction of the Second University of Naples. The \nInternational Study Group (ISG) Criteria for Beh\xc3\xa7et's Disease (27) was applied.\nPatients were treated with oral prednisone; sulfasalazine; clobetasol; and\ninterferon alpha-2a. Every month all patients had a complete blood count,\nplatelet count, and liver function test. Biopsies of genital ulcerations\nidentified small vessel vasculitis with mononuclear cell and lynphocytic\ninfiltrates. HLA-B27 and B5 were positive in three subjects. The pathergy test\nwas positive in all patients. Today the therapy is still ongoing, and none of the\npatients in therapy with our protocol present clinical symptoms of BD or\nintolerance. Laboratory findings are in a normal range and none have had\nneurological failure. Our findings may be attributable to less severe disease in \na patients, to our smaller number of patients, or to other unknown factors.\nNonetheless, these findings remain to be confirmed in a larger number of\npatients.\n\nPMID: 17937089  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2006 Aug 1.\n\nReduction of cardiovascular risk factors with longterm fish oil treatment in\nearly rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nCleland LG(1), Caughey GE, James MJ, Proudman SM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Rheumatology Unit, Royal Adelaide Hospital, North Terrace, Adelaide, Australia.\nlcleland@mail.rah.sa.gov.au\n\nComment in\n    J Rheumatol. 2006 Oct;33(10):1931-3.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with increased risk for\ncardiovascular (CV) events through multiple factors. Fish oil has been shown to\nreduce symptoms in RA and to reduce CV risk. We assessed the effect of an\nantiinflammatory dose of fish oil on CV risk factors within a program of\ncombination chemotherapy for patients with early RA.\nMETHODS: Patients who chose not to take fish oil (n = 13) were compared with\npatients who achieved a sustained elevation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in\nplasma phospholipid fatty acids (> 5% total fatty acids) while taking fish oil\nover a 3-year period (n = 18). We examined cellular content of arachidonic acid\n(AA), synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin E2, use of nonsteroidal\nantiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), traditional CV lipid risk factors, and disease\nactivity at 3 years.\nRESULTS: At 3 years, AA (as a proportion of AA plus long-chain n-3 fatty acids\nthat can compete with AA for cyclooxygenase metabolism) was 30% lower in\nplatelets and 40% lower in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in subjects taking \nfish oil. Serum thromboxane B2 was 35% lower and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated\nwhole-blood prostaglandin E2 was 41% lower with fish oil ingestion compared to no\nfish oil. NSAID use was reduced by 75% from baseline with fish oil (p < 0.05) and\nby 37% without fish oil (NS). Favorable changes in fasting blood lipids were seen\nwith, but not without fish oil. Remission at 3 years was more frequent with fish \noil use (72%) compared to no fish oil (31%).\nCONCLUSION: Fish oil reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with RA through\nmultiple mechanisms.\n\nPMID: 16881100  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Reumatismo. 2004 Jul-Sep;56(3):185-9.\n\n[The treatment of recurrent uveitis with TNF-alpha inhibitors].\n\n[Article in Italian]\n\nFalappone PC(1), Iannone F, Scioscia C, Grattagliano V, Covelli M, Lapadula G.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)DIMIMP--Sezione di Reumatologia, Universit\xc3\xa0 degli studi di Bari, Bari.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Uveitis is a severe manifestation of rheumatic diseases since it can\nlead to visual impairment and even blindness. Ocular involvement is frequently a \nclinical challenge because its occurrence often requires changes of the\ntherapeutic strategy. There are growing evidence that tumor necrosis factor alpha\n(TNFalpha) inhibitors may be an effective treatment of refractory uveitis.\nPurpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNFalpha\nblocking agents in patients with seronegative spondylo-arthropathies (SNSA) and\nBehcet disease (BD) associated relapsing uveitis.\nMETHODS: Five consecutive patients with chronic or relapsing uveitis were\nprospectively studied. Two patients with SNSA had recurrent anterior uveitis and \nthree patients had BD associated uveitis (one anterior, two posterior uveitis).\nAll of the patients were taking systemic and topical corticosteroids and three of\nthem were also treated with DMARDs (methotrexate, cyclosporine, sulphasalazine)\nwithout clinical benefit. Four patients received infliximab, an anti-TNFalpha\nmonoclonal antibody, at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight and one patient was\ntreated with etanercept, a TNFalpha receptor p75-Fc fusion protein, at a dosage\nof 25 mg twice weekly.\nRESULTS: Both infliximab and etanercept induced a marked improvement in uveitis\nand none relapse was observed throughout all the study. Systemic corticosteroids \nwere progressively tapered and stopped in all patients. Also methotrexate and\nsulphasalazine were discontinued, while cyclosporine dose has been reduced by\n30%. No side effects were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Therapy with TNFalpha blockers, infliximab and etanercept, was\neffective and safe in the treatment of rheumatic disease associated uveitis. A\ncomplete remission was achieved even in patients with severe steroid resistant\nuveitis. Further controlled studies on larger number of patients are needed to\nbetter define the different forms of ocular involvement that can benefit from the\ntherapy with TNFalpha inhibitors.\n\nPMID: 15470524  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

World J Gastroenterol. 2004 May 15;10(10):1513-20.\n\nDifferent therapy for different types of ulcerative colitis in China.\n\nJiang XL(1), Cui HF.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Gastroenterology, Chinese PLA General Hospital of Jinan Military\nCommand, 25 Shifanlu, Jinan 250031, Shandong Province, China.\njiangxueliang678@126.com\n\nAIM: To study the different therapy for different types of ulcerative colitis\n(UC) in China.\nMETHODS: Among 102 UC patients, 42 chronic relapse type UC patients were randomly\ndivided into olsalazine sodium treatment group (n=21) and SASP group (n=21).\nClinical effects and safety were observed in the 2 groups. Forty-two first\nepisode type UC patients were randomly divided into Heartleaf houttuynia herb\ntreatment group (n=21) and SASP group (n=21). Clinical effects were observed in\nthe 2 groups while ultrastructure of colonic mucosa, ICAM-1 and the pressure of\ndistant colon were studied in Heartleaf houttuynia herb group. Eighteen patients \n(8 males, 10 females) with refractory UC and unresponsive to high-dose\nprednisolone and sulfasalazine therapy more than one month were treated with\nKangshuanling (7200 U/d). Prednisolone was gradually stopped and sulfasalazine\nwas maintained. Stool frequency, rectal bleeding, colonoscopy, general\nwell-being, histology were observed and CD62p, CD63, CD54, Pgp-170 (flow\ncytometry), TXA2 (RIA), blood platelet aggregation rate and thrombosis length in \nvitro were assessed.\nRESULTS: In the 42 chronic relapse type UC patients, the overall clinical effects\nof olsalazine sodium group (complete remission in 16, improvement in 4,\ninefficiency in 1) were better than those of SASP group (complete remission in\n10, improvement in 4, inefficiency in 7, P<0.05). Symptomatic remission of\nolsalazine sodium group (complete remission in 15, partial remission in 5,\ninefficiency in 1) was better than that of SASP group (complete remission in 10, \npartial remission in 5, inefficiency in 6, P<0.05). The colonoscopic remission of\nolsalazine sodium group(complete remission in 11, partial remission in 9,\ninefficiency in 1) was better than that of SASP group (complete remission in 7,\npartial remission in 8, inefficiency in 6, P<0.05). The histologic remission of\nolsalazine sodium group (complete remission in 13, partial remission in 7,\ninefficiency in in 1) was better than that of SASP group (complete remission in\n6, partial remission in 10, inefficiency in 5, P<0.05). The side effects of\ngastrointestinal tract in olsalazine sodium group were less than those of SASP\ngroup except for frequency of watery diarrhea. No other side effects were\nobserved in olsalazine sodium group while ALT increase, WBC decrease and skin\neruption were observed in SASP group. Two patients relapsed in olsalazine sodium \ngroup while 8 cases relapsed in SASP group during the flow-up period (from six\nmonths to one year). In the 42 first episode type UC patients, the clinical\neffect of Heartleaf houttuynia herb group (complete remission in 20, 95.2%;\nimprovement in 1, 4.8%) was better than that of SASP group (complete remission in\n15, 72.4%, improvement in 5, 23.8%; inefficiency in 1, 3.8%, P<0.01). The time of\nstool frequency recovering to normal (5.6+/-3.3 d), and blood stool disappearance\n(6.7+/-3.8 d) and abdominal pain disappearance (6.1+/-3.5 d) in Heartleaf\nhouttuynia herb group was all shorter than that in SASP group (9.5+/-4.9 d,\n11.7+/-6.1 d, 10.6+/-5.3 d, P<0.01). Heartleaf houttuynia herb could inhibit the \nepithelial cell apoptosis of colonic mucous membrane and the expression of ICAM-1\n(45.8+/-5.7% vs 30.7+/-4.1%, P<0.05). Compared with normal persons, the mean\npromotive speed of contraction wave stepped up (4.6+/-1.6 cm/min vs 3.2+/-1.8\ncm/min, P<0.05) and the mean amplitude of the wave decreased (14.2+/-9.3 kPa vs\n18.4+/-8.0 kPa, P<0.05) in active UC patients. After treatment with Heartleaf\nhouttuynia herb, these 2 indexes improved significantly (17.3+/-8.3 kPa,\n3.7+/-1.7 cm/min, P<0.05). In normal persons, the postprandial pressure of\nsigmoid (2.9 +/-0.9 kPa) was higher than that of descending colon (2.0+/-0.7 kPa)\nand splenic flexure (1.7+/-0.6 kPa), while the colonic pressure (1.5+/-0.5 kPa,\n1.4+/-0.6 kPa, 1.3+/-0.6 kPa) decreased significantly (P<0.05) in active UC\npatients. After treatment with Heartleaf houttuynia herb, the colonic pressure\n(2.6+/-0.8 kPa, 1.8+/-0.6 kPa, 1.6+/-0.5 kPa) recovered to normal. The pain\nthreshold Heartleaf houttuynia herb, the colonic pressure (2.6+/-0.8 kPa,\n1.8+/-0.6 kPa, 1.6+/-0.5 kPa) recovered to normal. The pain threshold of distant \ncolon (67.3+/-18.9 mL) in active UC patients decreased significantly compared\nwith that of normal persons (216.2+/-40.8 mL, P<0.05) and recovered to normal\nafter treatment with Heartleaf houttuynia herb(187.4+/-27.2 mL, P<0.05). In the\n18 refractory UC patients with platelet activation, after more than 4 wk of\ncombined Kangshuanling and sulfasalazine therapy, 16 patients achieved clinical\nremission, with a highly significant statistical difference (P<0.01) between\npre-and post-treatment mean scores for all disease parameters: stool frequency\n(8.2/d vs 1.6/d), rectal bleeding (score 2.7 vs 0.3), colonoscopy (score 2.6 vs\n1.1), histology (score 12.0 vs 5.0), general well being (score 4.0 vs 0.6) and\nCD62p (8.0+/-3.1% vs 4.1+/-1.8%), CD63 (6.3+/-2.1% vs 3.2+/-1.6%), TXA2 (548+/-85\nng/L vs 390+/-67 ng/L), platelet aggregation rate (43.2+/-10.7% vs 34.8+/-8.1%), \nthrombosis length in vitro (2.3+/-0.6 cm vs 1.8+/-0.3 cm), CD54 in blood\n(26.9+/-6.9% vs 14.4+/-5.1%), CD54 in tissues (51.1+/-6.2% vs 23.1+/-4.1%),\nPgp-170 in blood (18.9+/-3.9% vs 10.4+/-2.7%), Pgp-170 in tissues (16.5+/-3.2% vs\n10.2+/-2.3%, P<0.01 or 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Based on the characteristics of UC cases in China, different therapy \nshould be given to different types of UC with expected satisfactory results.\n\nPMID: 15133864  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Arthritis Rheum. 2000 Nov;43(11):2488-92.\n\nEvaluation of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody seroconversion induced by\nminocycline, sulfasalazine, or penicillamine.\n\nChoi HK(1), Slot MC, Pan G, Weissbach CA, Niles JL, Merkel PA.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Case reports have suggested that minocycline, sulfasalazine, and\npenicillamine are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\n(ANCA)-positive vasculitis. This study evaluated ANCA seroconversion due to these\nagents in serum samples prospectively collected in randomized, double-blind,\ncontrolled trials.\nMETHODS: The sources of study sera were 3 clinical trials: 1) a 48-week trial of \nminocycline for early rheumatoid arthritis, with 64 patients receiving\nminocycline compared with 68 receiving placebo; 2) a 37-week trial of\nsulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis, with 51 receiving sulfasalazine compared \nwith 38 receiving placebo; and 3) a 104-week trial of penicillamine for early\nsystemic sclerosis, with 15 undergoing high-dose penicillamine treatment versus\n12 receiving low-dose penicillamine. ANCA were measured in the baseline and\nstudy-end serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) for perinuclear ANCA\n(pANCA) and cytoplasmic ANCA (cANCA) patterns, and by antigen-specific\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to myeloperoxidase\n(anti-MPO) and proteinase 3 (anti-PR3). Laboratory personnel were blinded to the \ngroup identity of the samples. ANCA results were interpreted using an ANCA\nscoring system that combines the results of IIF and ELISA testing.\nRESULTS: No patient in any of the active study drug groups demonstrated ANCA\nseroconversion according to the final interpretation of the combined IIF and\nELISA results. Twelve of the 248 patients (5%) were positive for anti-MPO with\npANCA at baseline. No subject was positive for anti-PR3 with cANCA. There were no\nfindings suggestive of vasculitis in any of these patients.\nCONCLUSION: From our study results, there was no suggestion of ANCA\nseroconversion induced by minocycline, sulfasalazine, or penicillamine. However, \nthese findings do not rule out the possibility of rare, sporadic cases of either \nANCA seroconversion or true drug-induced vasculitis with these drugs.\n\nPMID: 11083272  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Immunotherapy\nconsisted of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin and allogeneic myeloblasts given by\nvaccination, and chemotherapy comprised busulfan p.o. in most patients. No\nrandomly allocated control group was designated, but patient characteristics\nappear to be typical of those of other published groups. Twenty-eight of 31\npatients were followed from diagnosis to death, and the three remaining patients \nwere followed for over 5 years. The median survival of the patients in our group \nwas 37 months. There was a constant rate of decline in survival with time, with a\nmean annual death rate of 30% per year. Twenty-five of the 31 patients terminated\nin blast crisis. One of 21 patients achieved complete remission in blast crisis\nof myeloid or indeterminate type, and three of four patients achieved complete\nremission for blast crisis of lymphoid type. The median survival, the rate of\ndecline in survival, and the remission rate in blast crisis do not appear to\ndiffer from those of comparable groups of patients treated with chemotherapy\nalone.\n\nPMID: 6360347  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Group 1 (14 patients)\nreceived only monthly reinduction chemotherapy. Group 2 (17 patients) received\nidentical chemotherapy together with weekly immunotherapy combining BCG and\nirradiated leukemic cells. While the duration of the first complete remission was\nunmodified, the overall survival time and, above all, survival after the first\nrelapse were prolonged in group 2 chemoimmunotherapy. These results were all the \nmore marked when a homogeneous group of patients having received the same\ninduction chemotherapy were considered.\n\nPMID: 7036297  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The first\n16 patients were treated with weekly BCG and a leukemia cell vaccine (group 1).\nThe next 32 patients were randomly allocated to receive BCG and a leukemia cell\nvaccine given once monthly (group 2) or BCG given monthly with no leukemia cell\nvaccine (group 3). There was no significant difference in remission duration or\nsurvival between the randomly allocated groups (2 and 3). Comparisons with group \n1 are limited by the non-random allocation to this group, but selection bias was \nunlikely and clinical features were similar in the three patient groups. No\nsignificant difference in remission duration or survival was seen amongst the\nthree groups studied. There was no advantage in the addition of leukemia cell\nvaccine (groups 1 and 2) to BCG alone (group 3) and no advantage to weekly (group\n1) versus monthly immunotherapy (groups 2 and 3). Only 7 of the 48 patients\nachieved a second remission, and 4 of these were short-term partial remissions.\n\nPMID: 6760961  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

IT is clear that MER, albeit\napparently active alone in certain other clinical studies impairs the\nimmunotherapeutic value of neuraminidase treated allogeneic myeloblasts in AML\npatients. The in vivo and in vitro immunological tests results reflect the host's\nimmunological status in each arm of the protocol and correlate well with the\nduration of remission achieved with specific vs. combination of specific plus\nadjuvant immunotherapy.\n\nPMID: 161758  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A study of chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy in randomly selected \npatients with metastatic malignant melanoma revealed no significant increase in\neither complete remissions or overall survival in the group receiving\nchemoimmunotherapy. Preliminary results in a study involving maintenance of\npatients with acute myelogenous leukemia (chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy)\nrevealed suggestive but not statistically significant increases in remission\nduration and survival in the group receiving immunotherapy. Data from these\nongoing studies and plans for new group studies are presented in this paper.\n\nPMID: 344110  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, BCG\nimmunotherapy alone seems to be superior in terms of survival to no therapy,\nchemotherapy, and immunochemotherapy. This could be due to a better tolerance to \nsecondary treatments given at time of recurrence.\n\nPMID: 7036284  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Neurol India. 2014 Jan-Feb;62(1):42-7. doi: 10.4103/0028-3886.128280.\n\nSulfasalazine and temozolomide with radiation therapy for newly diagnosed\nglioblastoma.\n\nTakeuchi S(1), Wada K, Nagatani K, Otani N, Osada H, Nawashiro H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Neurosurgery, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki,\nTokorozawa, Saitama 359-8513, Japan.\n\nBACKGROUND: A recent phase 1/2 clinical trial argued for caution for the use of\nsulfasalazine in progressive glioblastoma (GBM). However, the study enrolled\npatients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma indicating that patients\nrecruited probably had severe disease. Thus, the study may not accurately reflect\nthe effectiveness of sulfasalazine for GBM and we hypothesized that earlier\nsulfasalazine administration may lead to anticancer effects.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sulfasalazine can improve\nthe outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed GBM.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients were treated with temozolomide and\nsulfasalazine with radiation therapy after surgery. Twelve patients with primary \nGBM treated with temozolomide and radiation therapy formed the control group.\nProgression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and seizure-free survival \n(SFS) curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. The survival curves\nwere compared using the log-rank test.\nRESULTS: The median OS, PFS and SFS did not differ between the groups. Grade 3 or\n4 adverse events occurred over the duration of the study in nine (75%) patients. \nThe median SFS was 12 months in nine patients who received sulfasalazine\nadministration for more than 21 days, which was strongly but not significantly\nlonger than the 3 months observed in the control group (P = 0.078).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sulfasalazine treatment with temozolomide plus radiotherapy for\nnewly diagnosed primary GBM is associated with a high rate of discontinuation due\nto hematologic toxic effects. This treatment may have no effect on OS or PFS,\nalthough it may improve seizure control if an adequate dose can be administered.\n\nPMID: 24608453  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. BMC Cancer. 2006 Jan 31;6:29.\n\nA phase 1-2, prospective, double blind, randomized study of the safety and\nefficacy of Sulfasalazine for the treatment of progressing malignant gliomas:\nstudy protocol of [ISRCTN45828668].\n\nRobe PA(1), Martin D, Albert A, Deprez M, Chariot A, Bours V.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Neurosurgery, University of Li\xc3\xa8ge, Domaine du Sart TIlman, B35,\n4000 Li\xc3\xa8ge, Belgium. pierre.robe@ulg.ac.be\n\nBACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients suffering from WHO grade 3 and 4 astrocytic\nglioma remains poor despite surgery, radiation therapy and the use of current\nchemotherapy regimen. Indeed, the median survival of glioblastoma multiforme (WHO\ngrade 4) patients is at best 14.6 month with only 26.5 percent of the patients\nstill alive after 2 years and the median survival of anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO\ngrade 3) is 19.2 month. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor\nNF-kappaB is constitutively expressed in malignant gliomas and that its\ninhibition by drugs like Sulfasalazine may block the growth of astrocytic tumors \nin vitro and in experimental models of malignant gliomas.\nDESIGN: ULg_GBM_04/1 is a prospective, randomized, double blind single-center\nphase 1-2 study. A total of twenty patients with progressive malignant glioma\ndespite surgery, radiation therapy and a first line of chemotherapy will be\nrecruited and assigned to four dosage regimen of Sulfasalazine. This medication\nwill be taken orally t.i.d. at a daily dose of 1.5-3-4 or 6 g, continuously until\ncomplete remission, evidence of progression or drug intolerance. Primary\nendpoints are drug safety in the setting of malignant gliomas and tumor response \nas measured according to MacDonald's criteria. An interim analysis of drug safety\nwill be conducted after the inclusion of ten patients. The complete evaluation of\nprimary endpoints will be conducted two years after the enrollment of the last\npatient or after the death of the last patient should this occur prematurely.\nDISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of\nSulfasalazine as a treatment for recurring malignant gliomas. The safety and\nefficacy of this drug are analyzed as primary endpoints. Overall survival and\nprogression-free survival are secondary endpoint.\n\nPMCID: PMC1368982\nPMID: 16448552  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S'\n1. Dermatology. 1999;198(4):388-90.\n\nPhotosensitivity with sulfasalazopyridine hypersensitivity syndrome.\n\nBouyssou-Gauthier ML(1), B\xc3\xa9dane C, Boulinguez S, Bonnetblanc JM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier R\xc3\xa9gional et Universitaire\nDupuytren, Limoges, France.\n\nFive weeks after the start of treatment with an association of\nsulfasalazopyridine and piroxicam, a 30-year-old woman presented with an\neczematous eruption in light-exposed areas, hepatomegaly and fever (38 degrees\nC). Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis, eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis.\nTreatment consisted of withdrawing the two drugs and topical steroids. The\nclinical signs regressed in 6 days. An increase in eosinophilia and hepatic\ncytolysis was observed until the tenth day, after which the trend reversed.\nLaboratory parameters were normal on the twentieth day. One month later,\nphotopatch testing was performed. A patch test with sulfanilamide irradiated with\nUVA was positive. Clinical and laboratory findings were highly suggestive of drug\nhypersensitivity syndrome. The positive result from the UVA photopatch test with \nsulfanilamide suggests that sulfasalazopyridine was involved in the occurrence of\nhypersensitivity syndrome in our patient. We conclude that photodistributed\neruptions can be observed in drug hypersensitivity syndrome with photosensitizing\ndrugs.\n\nPMID: 10449939  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, TNF-\xce\xb1\ninhibition may lead to adverse events, including liver injury. The RA patients\nare frequently treated with several potentially hepatotoxic drugs concomitantly; \nhence, a causative link between TNF-\xce\xb1 inhibitors and liver injury is usually\ndifficult to establish. We report two cases of RA patients who developed\nhistologically manifest liver injury shortly after the introduction of treatment \nwith two different TNF-\xce\xb1 inhibitors. Furthermore, we present the analysis of the \nlaboratory data from the BioRx.si registry (the Slovenian national registry of\nrheumatologic patients treated with biologicals) and provide evidence that\nelevated levels of serum aminotransferase can be observed in patients treated\nwith TNF-\xce\xb1 inhibitors. Additionally, our analysis suggests no significant\ndifferences between the impact of adalimumab and etanercept on aminotransferase\nlevels. Although the use of TNF-alpha inhibitors is safe and efficient, we\nsuggest that continuous careful monitoring of aminotransferase levels in patients\ntreated with these agents is probably warranted.\n\nPMID: 22955878  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Suspicion of this disorder obliges rapid withdrawal of the suspected\ndrug, which may have been introduced up to 3 months earlier. Screening for human \nherpesvirus (HHV) 6 reactivation is important both for its diagnostic value and\nfor its association with a poor prognosis. Reactivation of this virus is not a\ncontraindication for systemic corticosteroid treatment, which should be tapered\nslowly in order to avoid recurrence. The possible appearance of antiphospholipid \nantibodies must also be considered in those cases associated with\nthrombocytopenia, altered hemostasis, or thrombotic events. Autoimmune disorders \nmay also develop as a sequela of the condition. Medium-to-long-term follow-up is \nrequired even after complete resolution of the condition. We describe a new case \nof sulfasalazine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome associated with HHV-6\nreactivation and the induction of anticardiolipin and anti-thyroid peroxidase\nantibodies.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 Elsevier Espa\xc3\xb1a, S.L. y AEDV.

The type and duration of therapy varies considerably\namong reports and no single antibiotic is considered the treatment of choice. A\n61-year-old patient, suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (treated with\nmetotrexate and salazopyrine), presented with violaceous nodules of the right leg\nthat had been evolving for 6 months. She was underwent several skin biopsies.\nTissue culture of the last showed an atypical mycobacteria, identified as M.\nchelonae. Despite improvement after a two-week course of treatment with\nclarithromycin, a switch to ciprofloxacin was made because of gastrointestinal\nintolerance. After 3 months, only slight improvement of the lesions was achieved \nand clarithromycin was reintroduced; significant clinical improvement occurred by\nthe third month. Clarithromycin was continued a further two months until the\npatient quit on her own and. no recurrence was observed. Infections caused by M. \nchelonae frequently occur in the setting of immunological impairment.\nContaminated water is the natural reservoir, but we were unable to establish the \nsource of contamination. As was previously described, there was a significant\ndelay between clinical presentation and diagnosis. Thus, a high index of\nsuspicion and multiple biopsies with culture are of paramount importance to\nconfirming the diagnosis.\n\nPMID: 20409410  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Wiegering_V@kinderklinik.uni-wuerzburg.de\n\nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) has broad effects on the immune system\nincluding lymphoid organ development as well as growth, survival und function of \nimmune cells. TNFalpha has two main functions: regulatory effects and\nproinflammatory activities. In several diseases such as juvenile and adult\n"rheumatoid" arthritis, psoriasis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, the\napplication of TNFalpha-blocking medications has been beneficial. However,\ninduction of inflammation in several organs including the eye, CNS, skin and\ngastrointestinal tract has been reported. We report on an 11-year-old girl with\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, who developed Crohn\'s disease (CD) while taking\netanercept for her arthritis. Etanercept was discontinued and an antibody-based\nanti-TNF treatment using adalimumab was started, which induced remission of the\ngastrointestinal symptoms promptly. This case indicates that immunodysregulatory \nand even proinflammatory effects of etanercept are of relevance in the clinical\npractice. Furthermore, TNFalpha as a part of its function seems to downregulate\nmucosal inflammation in CD.\n\nPMID: 19506877  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

He\nwas treated with 1 g salazosulfapyridine (SASP) daily for two years.\nHematological investigations conducted since 2005 demonstrated hemoglobin\nconcentrations of 8 approximately 9 g/dl, which then dropped to 4.9 g/dl on\nNovember 21, 2007, following which he was admitted to our hospital. Megaloblastic\nanemia associated with SASP treatment and anemia of chronic disorders were\ndiagnosed on the basis of folate deficiency and bone marrow examination. This\nreport describes a case of megaloblastic anemia, which developed two years after \nstarting SASP and promptly recovered after its withdrawal and treatment with\nfolic acid and prednisolone. The doses of SASP prescribed for RA in Japan are\nless than those prescribed abroad. Megaloblastic anemia associated with SASP\ntreatment for RA is not usually detected in Japan. Currently, SASP is widely used\nand one of the key drugs in the treatment of RA. This case suggests that SASP\ntherapy in RA might result in megaloblastic anemia.\n\nPMID: 19110522  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Laboratory tests revealed a marked increase of atypical\nlymphocytes in the peripheral blood and biphasic hepatic dysfunction. IM-like\nsyndrome can be caused by various drugs, including SASP, and the concept of\ndrug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome has been proposed recently. IM-like\nsyndrome due to SASP has been reported in patients taking higher dosages for the \ntreatment of inflammatory bowel disease, but has not been reported earlier in\npatients with RA. The results of the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test\ntests suggested that 5-aminosalicylic acid was a possible causative metabolite.\nThis severe type of drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction mimicking IM due to\nSASP should be granted wider awareness in the field of rheumatology, because the \ndrug is widely used for the treatment of RA.\n\nPMID: 18084702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Eight years earlier he had presented a\nsimilar episode which had regressed spontaneously. The neurological examination\nrevealed a tetraparesis with areflexia and hypotonia. These manifestations were\nconcomitant with chronic diarrhea which had been neglected to date. The\nelectrophysiological aspect was compatible with an acute polyradiculoneuritis.\nThe analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed an albumino-cytological\ndissociation. The existence of the diarrhea directed the investigations towards\nan inflammatory enteropathy, which was attested later on by the endoscopic,\nradiologic and histological data leading to the diagnosis of active Crohn's\ndisease. The diagnosis of a relapsing polyradiculoneuritis associated with\nCrohn's disease was retained. The patient was treated by salazopyrine-budesonide \nwith improvement in the digestive and neurological manifestations after 3 years.\nCONCLUSION: The frequency of neurological features in Crohn's disease is not well\ndocumented. The incriminated mechanisms are either directly related to the\ndisease (deficit in B12 vitamin or folic acid and/or by the means of an\nauto-immune vascularitis) or secondary to long-term treatment with metronidazole.\nThe course of neurological manifestations is largely dependent on the course of\nthe inflammatory disease.\n\nPMID: 17351546  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The \nassociation of these two autoimmune diseases might be explained by\netiopathogenetic factors that they have in common. Recently there have been two\npatients observed (48 and 31-year old) in whom two and three years (respectively)\nafter diagnosing ulcerative colitis, symptoms of chronic nephropathy showed up\n(i.e. chronic glomerulonephritis and mild renal failure, respectively). Both of\nthem fulfilled the ACR criteria for SLE. Clinical features and results of\nlaboratory tests allowed the authors to recognize SLE with renal involvement\n(lupus nephritis in one and nephropathy in the course of secondary\nantyphospholipid syndrome in the other patient). In both cases drug-induced lupus\nlike syndrome was taken into consideration in differential diagnosis (as both of \nthe patients were previously treated with sulphasalazine) but clinical features\nand long lasting follow-up after sulphasalazine withdrawal allowed the authors to\nrecognize association of SLE with concomitant nephropathy and UC.

Her disease\nactivity was not influenced by a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)\nregimen that included bucillamine, D-penicillamine, gold, sulfasalazine, and\nmethotrexate. Due to an increased disease activity, her DMARD treatment regimen\nwas changed to leflunomide. She had also undergone corticosteroid therapy with\nprednisolone ranging from 10 to 15 mg daily over the previous 8 years. She first \npresented with a wound infection at the surgical site of resection arthroplasty\non her left foot, which had caused hematogenous dissemination that led to pelvic \nabscess and sepsis. For the next 2 years, she experienced multiple insufficiency \nfractures in parts of the ilium, sacral body, sacral ala, three thoraco-lumbar\nvertebral bodies (T12, L1, and L2), and subcapital femoral neck without low\nenergy trauma. Postmenopausal osteoporosis, pelvic abscess, sepsis, decreasing\ndaily activity, high RA disease activity, and high-load corticosteroid therapy\nwere considered to be the causes of these fractures. Nonspecific symptoms such as\nlow back pain and fever delayed diagnosis, which may have led to secondary\nfractures. Although her course after treatment was satisfactory during the study \nperiod, we recommend taking repetitive radiographs to detect insufficiency\nfracture for RA patients with continuing pain and reducing the corticosteroid\ndose to prevent infection and fracture.\n\nPMID: 17235652  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 40-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis\nwas admitted to a local hospital 26 days after initiation of sulphasalazine\ntreatment. She had fever, lymphadenopathy, dermatitis and facial oedema and\nshowed biochemical signs of progressive hepatitis. Peripheral blood counts showed\nelevated leucocyte count with 15% atypical plasmacytes. Lymph node biopsy showed \naltered follicular architecture, a diffuse CD 4 positive predominance and\nhistiocytes with erythrophagocytosis. Investigation by gene rearrangement for\nclonality of B- and T-lymphocytes ruled out the suspicion of lymphoma.\nHaematological and near-fatal hepatological changes resolved following\ndiscontinuation of sulphasalazine and a three-week course of glucocorticoid\ntherapy. Early awareness of this syndrome via measuring liver function tests on, \ne.g., days 14-35 in patients started on sulphasalazine is recommended.\n\nPMID: 17032600  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This study analyses their response to\ntreatment, duration of therapy, reasons for stopping, adverse effects, and the\ninfluence of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) phenotype.\nRESULTS: We observed 10 complete and 3 partial responses, and 4 patients\nmaintained complete response for at least 7 years. Eight patients experienced\nadverse effects, and 2 needed to stop treatment (because of photosensitization\nand development of antinuclear antibodies). All side effects occurred in the\nfirst 3 months of treatment. None of the 18 patients developed systemic lupus\nerythematosus. Of the 10 complete responders, 9 were rapid acetylators (RA),\nwhile 4 of the 5 who failed to respond were slow acetylators (SA). Leukopenia and\nphotosensitization were observed in SA patients, while different side effects\noccurred in RA patients (headaches, diarrhea, moderate increase in liver enzymes \nand antinuclear antibodies).\nCONCLUSION: These findings confirm our earlier reports and demonstrate that\nsulfasalazine can be used successfully to treat severe CLE. NAT2 genotyping\nbefore initiating treatment helps to identify potential responders and avoid side\neffects. In RA patients, sulfasalazine can be an alternative to thalidomide after\nantimalarial drugs, whereas in SA patients, it should remain a third-line\ntreatment, to be used only after antimalarials and thalidomide.\n\nPMID: 16840889  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient had typical symptoms of UC, and \ncolonoscopy showed pancolitis. During treatment with sulfasalazopyridine (SASP)\nand steroids, thrombocytopenia was observed. Despite the cessation of drugs,\nsevere thrombocytopenia was noted. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was\nsuspected based on a normal bone marrow megakaryocyte count, positive\nautoantibody to platelet membrane antigen, and the absence of splenomegaly.\nMedical treatment, including increased dosage of steroids, failed to control UC\nand acute thrombocytopenia in this patient. Moreover, acute severe pancreatitis\ndeveloped and abdominal computed tomography showed toxic megacolon. Platelet\ncount recovered after urgent total colectomy without splenectomy. When patients\nwith UC develop thrombocytopenia, particularly in the presence of extensive and\nsignificant colonic inflammation, a diagnosis of ITP should be considered. In\nsuch patients, preexisting UC might be involved in the immunological causal\nmechanism of ITP. In this situation, colectomy might cure both UC and resistant\nthrombocytopenia. Steroid-refractory and life-threatening UC complicated by\nthrombocytopenia presumably caused by ITP is therefore a possible indication for \ncolectomy.\n\nPMID: 16484745  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Initial treatment with cyclophosphamide and\nsteroids achieved complete remission. Subsequent relapse with marked retinal\nvasculitis at first was refractory to the standard treatment. Renewed remission\nwas obtained with additional infliximab, and was maintained with azathioprine for\n12 months before the patient again presented with symmetrical polyarthritis.\nINVESTIGATIONS: Clinical examination revealed a symmetrical polyarthritis\ninvolving the joints of the hand and fingers. The acute-phase parameters were\nraised, the rheumafactor was highly positive. Radiology showed early erosions in \nthe bones of the hand. There were no indices of renewed activity of the\nChurg-Strauss syndrome.\nTREATMENT AND COURSE: These findings indicated sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis\nand methotrexate was started, later supplemented with sulfsalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine because of continuing signs of activity. Infliximab was again \ngiven because of further progression, but a severe infusion reaction developed\nduring the second infusion. After changing to etanercept remission of the\nrheumatoid arthritis was achieved.\nCONCLUSION: The development of rheumatoid arthritis during remission achieved\nwith azathioprine in Churg-Strauss syndrome of four-year duration is very rare.\nRepeated dosis of infliximab at long intervals greatly increases the risk of an\nintolerance.\n\nPMID: 16118729  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Total gastrectomy was performed due to\ngastric ulcer in 1969. She was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 1985 and\nwas developed to amyloidosis in 1991. She was started on hemodialysis (HD) for\nchronic renal failure in 1996. In 1998, her arthralgia was aggravated, and 100\nmg/day of bucillamine was administered on the day of HD. Her arthralgia\npersisted, and switching to salazosulfapyridine (SASP) was considered. As there\nwere no standards and no reports for the use of SASP in HD patients, we examined \nthe pharmacokinetics of SASP and its metabolites, and compared our patient with\nthe results of phase one study in normal subjects in Japan. In this case, the\nblood concentration of SASP was similar to that in healthy controls after single \nadministration of 500 mg of SASP on the day of non-HD, while the concentration of\nsulfapyridine (SP) was higher than that in healthy donors. However, the blood\nconcentrations of SASP, SP, and N4-acetyl-SP (AcSP) at 24 hours after\nadministration were similar to those obtained in healthy men. SASP was not\ndialyzed, while about half of SP and AcSP, were dialyzed. In a five-day\nconsecutive administration study also, the blood concentrations of these\ncompounds on Day 5 were similar to those of phase one study, suggesting no\naccumulation. No adverse drug reaction was observed. As this case had the past\nhistory of total gastrectomy and amyloidosis, it is possible that this result is \ninfluenced by the factors. Therefore it is necessary to examine pharmacokinetics \nof SASP and its metabolites beforehand when administering this agent to other\nHD/RA patients.\n\nPMID: 12910967  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

IgA\nnephropathy first appeared at the age of 10 years. Combined therapy with\nprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, warfarin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitor resulted in clinical improvement over the following year, and remission\nwas maintained. At the age of 13 years, the patient developed Crohn disease and\nIgA nephropathy recurred. Significant increases in serum IgA were associated with\nprogression of Crohn disease. An elemental diet combined with oral prednisolone\nresulted in clinical improvement of Crohn disease and in remission of nephropathy\nand normalization of serum IgA concentration. The clinical course of the two\ndiseases was linked, suggesting a common pathogenetic mechanism involving an IgA \nimmune response to mucosal challenge in the intestine.\n\nPMID: 12376818  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, MTX therapy alone\nrarely results in remission and frequently does not even produce 50% improvement.\nTherefore, over the course of their disease, many patients will require\nadditional therapy to manage their clinical symptoms. A number of treatment\noptions have proven effective for such patients, most of which entail the\ncontinuation of MTX therapy and the addition of other DMARD. Although the\ncombination of MTX and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the one most commonly used in \nthe US, many clinicians (particularly in Europe) prefer the combination of MTX\nand sulfasalazine. In addition, excellent data now exist for the triple\ncombination of MTX, HCQ, and sulfasalazine in patients who have had a suboptimal \nresponse to MTX, as well as in those with early or well established disease.\nOther combinations, including MTX + cyclosporine or leflunomide, have also been\nhelpful in some patients. Most recently, the tumor necrosis factor blockers,\netanercept and infliximab, have successfully been used to treat a number of\npatients resistant to MTX. The combination of MTX with DMARD or biological agents\nwith different mechanisms of action greatly expands the treatment options for\npatients with RA.\n\nPMID: 11409154  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 26-year-old man was referred to our department, complaining of general\nfatigue, appetite loss, and palpitation. At age 14, blood was discovered in his\nstool and a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made. Since then, he has been\ntreated with salazosulfapyridine and prednisolone. On examination, mild\nexophthalmos and thyroid swelling were observed. Both serum free T3 and T4 levels\nwere increased along with a positive TSH receptor antibody, while TSH was\ndecreased. Scintigraphic and ultrasonographic examinations of the thyroid gland\nshowed diffuse enlargement. Treatment with thiamazole relieved the symptoms and\nnormalized the thyroid function. Although a high incidence of autoimmune thyroid \ndiseases in association with ulcerative colitis has been suggested, only 6 cases \nof hyperthyroidism coexisting with ulcerative colitis have been reported in\nJapan. A common immunological process has been suggested to be implicated in the \npathogenesis of this association, however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.\n\nPMID: 11201369  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

He was admitted to the municiple \nAkiru Hospital in October 1986 by fever, aphtous oral ulcerations, sore throat\nand polyarthralgia. Hematologic examination showed leukocytopenia,\nlymphocytopenia, positive tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody and\nLE cell phenomenon. He has had episodes of convulsion and conciousness loss of\nunknown etiology when he was 17 years old. The diagnosis of SLE was made, and\noral medication of prednisolone was started. Several weeks later, most of\nsymptoms and autoantibodies disappeared, although the oral aphtous ulcerations\nand leukocytopenia remained. In May 1987, he admitted to the other hospital\nbecause of bloody vomiting. Endoscopic examination showed the esophagial\nulceration, and histology of biopsied-specimen was nonspecific esophagitis. The\ncombination of prednisolone and oral cyclophosphamide or methotrexate was\nemployed thereafter. However, the leukocytopenia, oral aphtous ulceration and\nesophagial ulceration continued in spite of these treatments. All the\nimmunosuppressive treatment was stopped at March 1992. In October 1995, he\nadmitted to our hospital because of body weight loss and continuous diarrhea with\noccasional bloody stool. Barium enema and endoscopic examination of the colon\nrevealed the findings compatible with CD. The patient responded favorably to\nmethylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral sulphasalazine. This case\nindicated that cases with inflammatory bowel diseases like CD could show similar \nclinical signs and symptoms to SLE, and in some cases of CD might satisfied the\nclassification of criteria for SLE.\n\nPMID: 11126669  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Although the physiological mechanism of diarrhea is not\nclear, patients do not usually present hydroelectrolytic alterations and the\nresults of routine laboratory investigations are usually normal. The association \nbetween lymphocytic colitis and thyroid disease, possibly autoimmune, in the form\nof hypo- or hyperthyroidism is relatively common. We report a 61-year-old woman\nwith a history of multinodular toxic goiter, whose previously uninvestigated\nchronic diarrhea became more acute and led to the diagnosis of lymphocytic\ncolitis. Results of laboratory investigations revealed only a significant\nhypokalemia with an associated nonfunctioning bilateral adrenal incidentaloma.\nThe patient evolved well when treated with sulfasalazine. Hypokalemia as a\ncomplication of lymphocytic colitis and an association between lymphocytic\ncolitis and toxic multinodular goiter does not seem to have been previously\ndescribed.\n\nPMID: 10726387  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Oral\nsulphasalazine, 2.5 grams daily was successfully used as an alternative treatment\n(3 month follow-up). Two patients, aged 71 and 84 year old, were treated with\ndapsone for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. Both patients stopped their treatment \nbecause of drug induced hemolytic anemia. They then received oral sulphasalazine,\n4 grams daily. The disease was successfully controlled. In the first patient,\nsulphasalazine was discontinued after 13 months; and in the second patient no\nrelapse was seen after a 16 month follow-up period. No adverse side effect of\nsulphasalazine occurred.\nCONCLUSION: Sulphasalazine, that has already been proven to be effective for\nCrohn's disease, also can be used in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. However,\nfurther studies including a larger series of patients along with a longer\nfollow-up are necessary to confirm the efficacy of sulphasalazine in this\ndisease.\n\nPMID: 10365328  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

She was referred to us for persistent edema on her\nface and legs in November 1996. On admission, her 24-hour urinary protein\nexcretion was 4.4 g/day, total serum protein level was 5.3 g/dl, and serum level \nof amyloid A protein (SAA) was elevated to 45.8 mg/ml. A percutaneous renal\nbiopsy was performed, and light microscopy revealed varying degrees of amyloid\ndeposits in the mesangial areas and arteriolar walls. The diagnosis of secondary \namyloidosis (AA amyloidosis) was based on immunohistochemical staining for\namyloid A protein using monoclonal antibody against SAA. Four weeks after\ntreatment with salazosulfapyridine (SASP) and dipyridamole, proteinuria began to \ndecrease and the edema had disappeared. Finally she recovered from nephrotic\nsyndrome. AA amyloidosis has been thought to have a poor prognosis, with\nprogression to renal failure. Since there is no specific effective therapy for\nthe disease, it is very important to reduce the activity of the underlying cause.\nIn our patient with renal amyloidosis following RA, SASP was evidently effective \nfor arthritis and improvement of renal function. SASP might have a beneficial\neffect on AA amyloidosis by suppressing inflammatory cytokines.\n\nPMID: 9805922  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Its etiologies\nare most commonly viral or bacterial infections, lymphoproliferative syndromes,\nacquired or congenital immunodeficiencies, systemic diseases, or immunomodulatory\ntreatment. We describe a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with\nmethotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, and low dose corticosteroids, whose case was\nseriously complicated by the occurrence of acute febrile pancytopenia. The\npancytopenia appeared secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome triggered by\nEscherichia coli septicemia. The evolution was marked by severe aggravation of\nRA, probably due to release of cytokines from macrophages (tumor necrosis\nfactor-alpha, interleukin 6). Reintroduction of MTX (without sulfasalazine)\nresulted in partial remission and there was no reappearance of new hematological \nanomalies after 16 month followup. A knowledge of this syndrome is particularly\nimportant, since it mimics drug toxicity and other complications such as\nlymphoproliferative diseases.\n\nPMID: 9632090  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Factors that affect the life span of erythrocytes will also\ninfluence HbA1c results. In this study, we describe two patients with IDDM, whose\nregularly determined HbA1c values were considerably decreased with the\nconcomitant use of two related sulfonamide drugs, sulfasalazine and dapsone. The \nfall in HbA1c results is explained by increased erythrocytopoiesis as a product\nof drug-induced hemolysis. Fructosamine concentrations are not affected by\nhemolysis and reflected glycemic control better. We conclude that under\nconditions of persistent (subclinical) hemolysis, as occurs during the use of\nsulfonamides, HbA1c is not a reliable indicator of glycemic control.\n\nPMID: 8799639  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In paediatric patients, the drug has been used to treat inflammatory\nbowel disease and is currently under investigation for the treatment of juvenile \nchronic arthritis. Although sulphasalazine has a rather low incidence of serious \nside effects, one of the most common is skin rash, thought to be an allergic\nreaction. In adults, sulphasalazine desensitization programmes have proven to be \neffective for the treatment of this side effect. We present the case of a\n7-year-old boy suffering from HLA-B 27 positive juvenile chronic arthritis. After\ninitiation of treatment with sulphasalazine he developed an allergic skin rash,\nbut tolerated the drug well after completion of a desensitization programme.

We report\nthe first case of a patient being treated for rheumatoid arthritis who developed \nsevere dyspnoea with chest radiograph shadowing, reversible on discontinuation of\nsulphasalazine and subsequent steroid therapy. An histological diagnosis of\nfibrosing alveolitis was made. Thirteen cases of similar reactions to\nsulphasalazine, all in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease, can be\nfound in the literature. We identify two types of pulmonary reaction, an\neosinophilic pneumonitis and a fibrosing alveolitis. Adequate histological\ninvestigation is needed to differentiate between the two and management may be\ndifferent. The diagnosis of pulmonary reactions are important because they can be\neasily confused with complications of the underlying disease but the prognosis is\nmuch better.\n\nPMID: 1972634  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Soon after the \nstart of this medication she developed progressive cough and shortness of breath.\nAfter two years she was referred for evaluation of a hemoptysis and a reddish\nskin lesion. The chest radiograph showed wide spread interstitial infiltrates in \nthe lower lobes and some fibrotic changes. FVC was slightly reduced, DLCO\nmarkedly reduced. There was a high percentage of eosinophils in the\nbronchoalveolar lavage (55.2%). Transbronchial lung biopsy and skin biopsy\ndemonstrated epitheloid granulomata. SSP was discontinued. After a short period\nof prednisone treatment the patient's condition improved considerably. After two \nmonths of followup neither pulmonary infiltrates nor any skin lesions were found.\nHistory and the clinical course after discontinuation of SSP indicate the\nrelation of these infiltrates to SSP treatment. The previously published case\nreports of SSP-related lung disorders are reviewed. Three of these case reports\nincluded bronchoalveolar lavage. Our data suggest that patients with SSP related \npulmonary infiltrates may have a marked increase of eosinophils in the\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n\nPMID: 1972576  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In three patients a favourable\neffect on the symptoms was noted. In one of these patients a year-long prednisone\ntreatment was withdrawn and replaced by sulphasalazine. In all these cases,\nhowever, a decrease was seen in leucocyte counts to subnormal levels after the\naddition of sulphasalazine to a basis therapy with azathioprine 150-200 mg/d\n(2.1-3.3 mg/kg). The effect was only transitory in two patients, while it lasted \nseveral months in the third. In a fourth patient agranulocytosis developed after \nfour days following the combined treatment with azathioprine 150 mg/d (2.3 mg/kg)\nand 250-1000 mg/d (4-15 mg/kg) of sulphasalazine, lasting four days before\nrecovery. A later resumption of the combination therapy with these same drugs,\nbut in a lower dosage, did not induce any acute changes in leucocyte counts. The \nskin rash provoked by sulphasalazine in two of the patients did not recur after\ndesensitization. It is concluded, that this combination therapy is valuable in\nadult Still's disease, but that caution should be exerted during the initiation\nof sulphasalazine therapy. This should be monitored by daily measurements of\nleucocyte counts in the first weeks and preferably started by the use of a\ndesensitising kit.\n\nPMID: 2887331  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Remarkably, in all six\ncases the relatively early hemogram alterations appear as soon as the start of\ntherapy and prompt normalization of blood counts occurs after instant termination\nof sulfasalazine therapy. Possible mechanisms for the occurrence of these\nsulfasalazine-induced hematological complications are discussed. These\nobservations, also described by other authors, should be a cause for more\nfrequent blood count tests during sulfasalazine therapy, at least during the\nfirst 3 months on a weekly basis. Sulfasalazine represents an asset among the\nrather limited number of basic therapies available for chronic rheumatoid\narthritis. Despite the fact that it is comparatively well tolerated, a close\nfollow-up of the therapy, especially during the initial phases of treatment, is\nof utmost importance in order to seize upon these reversible hematological\ndisorders at an early stage and thus avoid more serious complications.\n\nPMID: 2885991  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Report on 7 cases, possible\ntreatment and review of the literature].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nLang B, Weber S, Maas D.\n\nWarm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare but typical\nextraintestinal complication of ulcerative colitis. Seven cases with this\ncondition are reported here and 24 further cases from the literature are\nreviewed. There were no essential differences between the two groups of patients \nwith respect to clinical and immuno-hematological findings. However, the\nintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs has led to a change in therapy and\nprognosis in recent years. Our observations suggest that treatment with steroids \nand azathioprine is to be recommended, with accompanying therapy of the\nunderlying disease. In patients failing to respond to this immunosuppressive\nregimen, splenectomy or surgical treatment of the affected intestines must be\nconsidered. For every patient with ulcerative colitis and hyperregenerative\nanemia the possibility of warm autoantibody formation must be ruled out by\nperforming the direct antiglobulin test.\n\nPMID: 2862702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The clinical pattern resembled drug-induced systemic lupus\nerythematosus and has resolved since her sulphasalazine was discontinued.\nSulphasalazine-induced lupus syndrome has never been reported in a child. The\nhistory illustrates the role of sulphasalazine in the development of this\nsyndrome.\n\nPMID: 6135611  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Polyarthralgias and\npleuritic chest pains resolved and leucopenia, anemia, and high titers of\nantinuclear and DNA antibodies returned to normal after withdrawal of the drug.\nNo HLA antigen association was found but a slow acetylation phenotype was\npresent.

The lupus affection was\nmade evident by the toxicodermia and lupic manifestations may regress\nspontaneously after recovery from the skin disorder. This emphasizes the value of\nclinical and biological testing for the presence of LE in severe cases of\ntoxicodermia in women, more particularly immunofluorescent studies of the basal\nstructures in the cutaneous lesions.\n\nPMID: 44163  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 23-year-old man was diagnosed as UC in January 1991 and had been \ntreated with salazosulfapyridine and prednisolone with good effect. In September \n1993, he developed bleeding tendency and a diagnosis of APL with disseminated\nintravascular coagulation was made based on the results of bone marrow aspiration\nand coagulation profile. Complete remission was achieved with All-trans retinoic \nacid together with combined chemotherapy. He died of sepsis during consolidation \nchemotherapy in December 1993.

Epub 2007 Apr 19.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis in a patient with Turner syndrome: a case report.\n\nArmagan O(1), Ekim A, Dinc A, Oner C.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir\nOsmangazi University Medical School, Meselik Campus, 26480, Eskisehir, Turkey.\naoarmagan@superonline.com\n\nTurner's syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder where phenotypic females have\neither a missing chromosome (45 X0) or a structural aberration of one of the\nchromosomes. It is possible for TS to accompany such autoimmune diseases as\nthyroid diseases, inflammatory intestinal diseases, diabetes mellitus, psoriatic \narthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Herein, we present an unusual case\nwith Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and autoimmune thyroiditis associated with TS.\nWe suggest that the possibility that TS patients may also develop such other\ndiseases as AS apart from the already known accompanying autoimmune diseases\nshould not be ruled out when monitoring TS patients.\n\nPMID: 17443326  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In the singleton pregnancy, the mother had ulcerative\ncolitis, and the infant, a male, had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular\nseptal defect. In the twin pregnancy, the mother had Crohn's disease. The first\ntwin, a female, had a left Potter-type IIa polycystic kidney and a rudimentary\nleft uterine cornu. The second twin, a male, had some features of Potter's\nfacies, hypoplastic lungs, absent kidneys and ureters, and talipes equinovarus.\nDespite reports to the contrary, it is suggested that sulphasalazine may be\nteratogenic.\n\nPMID: 6133211  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two\nphenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations\nwithin the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT\ninterval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial\nfeatures, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of\nTS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have\ncortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted\nmutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS\nassociated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene\nmutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand\nboth the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nPMCID: PMC3319791\nPMID: 22106044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

She was born with\nmild dysmorphic features and common cardiac abnormalities. However, she\nre-presented at 2.5 months of age with a pericardial effusion. We decided to\nembark on a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids and salicylic acid therapy in an\nattempt to avoid pericardectomy. After 3 weeks of medical treatment the effusion \nresolved. This experience allows us to propose that medical management with\ncorticosteroids and salicylic acid can be considered as an alternative to\nsurgical therapy for CDGS-I patients with persistent pericardial effusions.\n\nPMID: 12170369  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sodium salicylate is the main therapeutic choice \nfor acute idiopathic pericarditis. In vitro studies have demonstrated the role\nplayed by sodium salicylate in the inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase, but, at therapeutic doses, this inhibition is not enough to\nexplain acetylsalicylic acid-induced hemolysis observed in vivo. We thus treated \na patient affected by acute idiopathic pericarditis and glucose 6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase deficiency with sodium salicylate, obtaining complete resolution of\nfever and symptoms, without any hemolytic complication. Therapy with sodium\nsalicylate could thus be a safe and effective alternative for patients with\nglucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase who require anti-inflammatory therapy.\n\nPMID: 10920507  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Although it is typically associated with a serious\ninfection and referred to as sepsis, SIRS can stem from noninfectious causes, as \nwell. We report the cases of four patients with toxic serum levels of salicylate \n(33.5 to 67.6 mg/dL) and SIRS, and we discuss mechanisms responsible for SIRS.\nOur patients showed temperature disturbances (35.5 degrees C to 39.8 degrees C), \nnoncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and mixed acid base disturbances. Other\nabnormalities included coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation),\nencephalopathy, and hypotension. All four patients recovered from SIRS, probably \ndue to early recognition and treatment; only one patient did not survive the\nhospitalization. Chronic salicylate toxicity should be considered as a cause of\nSIRS in the absence of a source of infection, since survival appears to be\ndependent on prompt diagnosis and management.\n\nPMID: 8638172  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The cardiac rhythm returned \nto normal as the serum salicylate concentration decreased, and results of\nsubsequent electrophysiologic testing and Holter monitoring were normal. A low\nserum albumin level may have resulted in altered salicylate binding in this\npatient, thereby increasing the availability of unbound (active) drug for toxic\neffects.\n\nPMID: 3952006  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is commonly associated with cutaneous signs. Herein we\nreport a case of atypical cutaneous eruption occurring during the course of APS\nand we discuss the possible mechanism.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A 45-year-old woman consulted twice within six months for\nan erythematosus papular eruption around the neckline. She was being followed-up \nfor antiphospholipid syndrome treated with fluindione (Pr\xc3\xa9viscan\xc2\xae), and her\nInternational Normalized Ratio (INR) was consistent with the prescribed\nanticoagulation target. Blood tests confirmed the presence of anticardiolipin and\nantiphospholipid antibodies, but no laboratory evidence of lupus was seen.\nHistopathological examination of a skin biopsy demonstrated the presence within\nthe vascular lumen of a weakly eosinophilic anhistic substance positive for PAS\nstain. The patient was given acetone salicylic acid (Kard\xc3\xa9gic\xc2\xae) combined with\nfluindione, and four years later, she had presented no relapses.\nDISCUSSION: Despite a clinically evocative appearance, the diagnosis of lupus\ntumidus was ruled out in our patient by histopathological features, and\nassociated systemic lupus erythematosus was repeatedly refuted on the basis of\nclinical and laboratory data. We suggest that the specific histological images of\nintraluminal deposits within the dermal vessels seen in this patient, although\nnot typical of thrombosis, are associated with APS. The clinical remission seen\nfrom the start of antiplatelet treatment could be due to the action of these\ndrugs against the obstruction of small-calibre dermal vessels.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The\nlesions did not respond to a 20-day systemic steroid regimen. The results of\nbiopsies of three excised lesions, in combination with the clinical\nmanifestations, led to the diagnosis of subcorneal pustular dermatosis type of\nIgA pemphigus. An unexpected improvement was noted after treatment with\nazithromycin (which was provided for management of concurrent non-specific\nurethritis) and local non-potent steroid plus keratolytic agent ointment.\n\nPMID: 16038746  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The cardiac rhythm returned \nto normal as the serum salicylate concentration decreased, and results of\nsubsequent electrophysiologic testing and Holter monitoring were normal. A low\nserum albumin level may have resulted in altered salicylate binding in this\npatient, thereby increasing the availability of unbound (active) drug for toxic\neffects.\n\nPMID: 3952006  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Puncture of the psoas abscess\nalso grew M bovis-BCG. The patient recovered with a combination of\nantituberculous treatment and surgery. With hindsight a mycotic aneurysm had been\npresent at the time of aortic graft placement and spondylodiscitis at the time of\nvertebroplasty.

We present a case of\nMycobacterium bovis AAA in a 69-year-old male after treatment with intravesicular\nbacillus Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) therapy for bladder carcinoma. The classical\napproach for mycotic AAA entails extra-anatomic reconstruction followed by\nresection with oversewing of the proximal and distal aortic stumps. Alternative\nin-line reconstruction options have also been advocated. This case illustrates a \ntechnically straightforward, durable, in-line repair within an infected field\nutilizing cryopreserved aortic allograft.\n\nPMID: 23081891  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A clinical case was reviewed for its initial\npresentation, planning of treatment strategy and outcome. A secondary literature \nsearch for discussion on current accepted recommendations for primary\naortoenteric fistula was then completed. Aortoenteric fistulas are rare\npathologies with highly morbid potential. Their diagnosis requires a high index\nof suspicion and prompt intervention is critical to patient survival. In\nconclusion, aortoenteric fistula most commonly arises from large atherosclerotic \naneurysms but can be caused by systemic infection. In the case of the latter,\nextra-anatomic repair appears to be the treatment of choice.\n\nPMID: 22871545  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We describe a rare case of supra-renal mycotic aortic\naneurysm secondary to BCG instillation in a 75-year-old male. Patients presenting\nwith systemic symptoms post-instillation, possibly with an aneurysm, should raise\nsuspicion of BCG dissemination, which requires early instigation of\nanti-mycobacterial drugs.\n\nPMID: 21677913  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Histopathologic examination of\nresected tissue revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli, and subsequent mycobacterial\nculture of blood and resected tissue revealed BCG strain Mycobacterium bovis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possible extravesical\ncomplications, albeit rare, of BCG therapy. Therapy should consist of combined\nmedical and surgical management.\n\nPMID: 19026573  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Alfred Taubman Center, University of Michigan \nMedical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0314, USA.\n\nSulfasalazine is used as a therapy for various autoimmune conditions, including\npsoriasis; its effectiveness is presumed to be the result of its immunomodulatory\neffects. We have treated patients with severe alopecia areata with sulfasalazine \nas part of our dermatology practice and have noticed cosmetically acceptable\nregrowth in 23% of patients in whom a response could be determined. In view of\nits good safety profile, sulfasalazine may be considered for systemic treatment\nof severe alopecia areata.\n\nPMID: 11907504  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This is the oldest patient ever\nreported to have this condition. The patient was advised to avoid water exposure \nas much as possible and to wear gloves. Topical treatment with 5% salicylic acid \nin Vaseline also provided some relief. TRPA presents with translucent, white,\nconfluent papules that become evident on the palms after 3-5 minutes' exposure to\nwater (the so-called 'hand-in-the-bucket' sign) and resolve within a short time\nafter drying. It is a rare disorder with fewer than 40 cases having been reported\nin the world literature. The disease is seen mostly in female patients, with ages\nranging from 6 to 44 years prior to our case in a 50-year-old woman. The most\ncommon histologic findings are hyperkeratosis and dilated eccrine ostia. The\netiopathogenesis of the disease remains unknown but a transitory structural or\nfunctional alteration of components of the stratum corneum or aberration of the\nsweat duct have been considered. TRPA has been reported in patients with cystic\nfibrosis and more recently, in patients taking selective cyclo-oxygenase-2\ninhibitors. Therefore, the pathogenesis of the condition appears to be related to\nincreased water absorption as a result of an increased epidermal sodium level.\nTreatment with barrier creams such as hydrophilic petrolatum, glycerin\nemollients, 5-20% salicylic acid in Vaseline, 10% urea cream, and 12% ammonium\nlactate cream have been reported. Cases with associated hyperhidrosis respond\nwell to aluminum chloride-containing products.\n\nPMID: 18973409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

An elderly man presented with multiple fungating growths,\nwhich were painless but associated with mild itching and serous discharge, on the\nright foot for 40 years. The lesions were free from deeper structures and no\ninguinal lymphadenopathy was observed. A provisional diagnosis of epithelioma was\nmade based on the features described. However, incisional biopsy indicated that\nthe lesions were tuberculous. As part of the anti-tubercular therapy, the lesions\nwere excised and the wounds covered with split-thickness skin graft. The\npatient's recovery was uneventful, with no graft loss or infection reported. This\ncase illustrates the importance of recognising cutaneous forms of tuberculosis,\nespecially TVC, as an important differential diagnosis of epithelioma.\n\nPMID: 23546037  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Complications of BCG\ntherapy include local infections and disseminated BCG infection with multiple\nendorgan complications.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of disseminated, post-treatment BCG infection\nthat initially presented with granulomatous hepatitis and choroiditis. After\nsuccessful anti-mycobacterial therapy and resolution of the hepatic and ocular\nabnormalities, the patient developed an acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage\nfrom an aortoduodenal fistula that required emergency surgery. The resection\nspecimen revealed multifocal, non-caseating granulomas, indicating mycobacterial \ninvolvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the varied end organ complications of\ndisseminated BCG infection, and the need for vigilance even in immuno-competent\npatients with a history of intravesical BCG treatment.\n\nPMCID: PMC3193172\nPMID: 21961922  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The genetic and phenotypic correlation \nhas been described.\nMETHODS: We report a unique clinical presentation and the identification of a\nnovel missense mutation in the NEMO gene in a 3-year-old boy with bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin (BCG) infection.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and abnormal\nanti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers, suggestive of EBV-related diseases\nincluding chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, or\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although the biopsy specimen from a nasopharyngeal\nlesion was initially diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, this was changed to\ndisseminated BCG infection involving the nasopharynx, multiple systemic lymph\nnodes, and brain. A novel mutation (designated D311E) in the NEMO gene, located\nin the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain, was identified as the underlying\ncause of the immunodeficiency. Impaired immune responses which are characteristic\nof patients with NEMO deficiency were demonstrated. The patient underwent\nsuccessful unrelated bone marrow transplantation at 4.9\xc2\xa0years of age.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of the NUB domain in host defense \nagainst mycobacteria. The unique presenting features in our patient indicate that\na hypomorphic NEMO mutation can be associated with atypical pathological findings\nof the epithelial tissues in patients with BCG infection.\n\nPMID: 21755389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This report presents the case of a\n56-year-old man who presented with multiorgan failure after bacille\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) treatment for stage T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the\nbladder. On admission the patient was jaundiced, had inflammatory infiltrates on \nchest radiography and required dialysis for renal failure. He had a persisting\nfever of unknown origin and elevated cholestatic liver function tests, which\nprompted a liver biopsy.This demonstrated hypersensitivity hepatic granuloma but \nno organism was identified. He responded well to steroid and antimycobacterial\ntreatment. A small percentage of BCG-treated patients suffer hypersensitivity\nside-effects (pneumonitis, hepatitis or interstitial nephritis). This\ncomplication most commonly follows a traumatic installation. Mycobacteriumbovis\nis rarely cultured or identified using polymerase chain reaction techniques, and \nthe diagnosis is based on histological findings of granuloma.\n\nPMID: 21329482  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Chest CT showed bilateral\ninfiltration of the lungs. Patient was placed on anti-tuberculosis treatment\nincluding isoniazid, rifampycin, ethambutol and methylprednisolone initially; and\nthis treatment was adjusted according to his clinical course and liver function\ntests. By the end of the 4th week of hospitalisation patient was responded well\nwith normalisation of his clinical status, liver function tests and a normal\nchest X-ray. Thereafter, he was discharged home on isoniazid, ethambutol for 6\nmonths, streptomycin, cycloserine-C and ofloxacin for 2 months,\nmethylprednisolone which was stopped eventually after dose reduction. On\nfollow-up at 6th month after discharge from the hospital, he was fully recovered \nwith normal chest X-ray and blood tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Development of severe sepsis is inevitable following inadvertent\nintravascular BCG administration. Therefore, urologists should warn and inform\nnot only their patients and families but also healthcare workers such as nurses\nregarding the route of administration of the BCG treatment for bladder cancer.\nOur experience also proved that such a serious complication can be successfully\ntreated if promptly acted.\n\nPMID: 21317964  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

BCG-mediated anti-tumor\nactivity appears to be a local phenomenon in which cell-mediated immunity,\ninvolving cytotoxic T cells, lymphokine-activated killer cells and natural killer\ncells, is important for the elimination of malignant cells. Serious side-effects \nof BCG therapy are rare; nevertheless, BCG is a live, attenuated strain of\nMycobacterium (M.) bovis and may exhibit invasive properties. Both local and\ndistant or generalized infections have been reported after treatment with BCG. We\ndescribe the case of a 68-year-old man who developed bone marrow infection with\nBCG two years after intravesical instillation of BCG for treatment of superficial\nbladder cancer. He presented with intermittent fever, weight loss and pronounced \npancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed granulomatous inflammation and\nBCG was cultured from the urine. Anti-mycobacterial treatment with isoniazid,\nrifampicin and ethambutol (pyrazinamide is inactive against M. bovis) led to full\nclinical recovery of the patient.\n\nPMID: 18322775  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A rare but \nsevere complication of BCG immunotherapy is the development of disseminated BCG\ndisease, which can result in miliary pneumonitis, granulomatous hepatitis, soft\ntissue infections, bone marrow involvement, and sepsis. Symptoms can present as\nearly as a few hours or as late as several months following the BCG therapy. The \nkey finding in disseminated BCG disease is the formation of caseating granulomas \nin distant organs; detection of BCG organisms from tissue samples can be\ndifficult. Recommended treatment for disseminated BCG disease includes a\ncombination of antituberculous medications (with the exception of pyrazinamide,\nto which BCG is typically resistant) and a tapering course of steroids. We\npresent the cases of four patients who developed granulomatous infection\nconsistent with disseminated disease after intravesical BCG treatment and provide\na summary of current clinical management recommendations.\n\nPMID: 18176300  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Occasionally, BCG infection\ncomplicates such treatment. In some patients, infection appears early (within 3\nmonths after instillation) and is characterized by generalized symptoms, with\npneumonitis and hepatitis. Late-presentation disease occurs >1 year after the\nfirst BCG treatment and usually involves focal infection of the genitourinary\ntract (the site at which bacteria were introduced) and/or other sites that are\ntypical for reactivation of mycobacterial disease, such as the vertebral spine or\nthe retroperitoneal tissues. Noncaseating granulomas are found in the majority of\ncases, whether early or late. Most patients respond to treatment with\nantituberculous drugs; in early-presentation disease, when features of\nhypersensitivity predominate, glucocorticosteroids are sometimes added. Late\nlocalized infection often requires surgical resection.\n\nPMID: 12522745  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The records of all patients were\nreviewed to determine the incidence of caseating granulomata containing acid-fast\nbacilli together with the incidence of toxicity and the outcome of treatment.\nRESULTS: Five patients were found to have persisting acid-fast mycobacteria in\ntheir urine or bladder up to 16.5 months after completing intravesical\ninstillations of BCG. In one patient this probably accounted for bladder symptoms\nthat required palliative cystectomy. In four patients the 'infection' was not\nsevere. Two patients were treated with antituberculous chemotherapy without\ncomplication. Three years after intravesical BCG therapy 36 of 69 patients (52%) \nhad remained tumour free.\nCONCLUSION: BCG organisms can persist in the urinary tract for at least 16.5\nmonths after the completion of intravesical BCG instillation therapy.\n\nPMID: 7850324  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We report here two cases of culture-proven pulmonary infection due to\ntherapy with BCG. The first patient, who was seropositive for the human\nimmunodeficiency virus, developed bilateral interstitial pneumonitis after\ninstillation of BCG into the bladder. The second patient developed a\nright-lower-lobe infiltrate and empyema after instillation of BCG into the right \nrenal pelvis. The clinical isolates from these two patients and from a third\npatient with a psoas abscess following intravesical instillation were analyzed\nwith use of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to resolve chromosomal\nrestriction fragment polymorphisms. The clinical isolates were confirmed to be\nBCG by comparison with known vaccine strains that differed from M. bovis\nisolates. We conclude that the potential for subsequent dissemination be\nconsidered prior to the intravesical administration of BCG. Analysis with PFGE\nmay be useful for identifying species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.\n\nPMID: 8104511  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

He\nwas treated with 1 g salazosulfapyridine (SASP) daily for two years.\nHematological investigations conducted since 2005 demonstrated hemoglobin\nconcentrations of 8 approximately 9 g/dl, which then dropped to 4.9 g/dl on\nNovember 21, 2007, following which he was admitted to our hospital. Megaloblastic\nanemia associated with SASP treatment and anemia of chronic disorders were\ndiagnosed on the basis of folate deficiency and bone marrow examination. This\nreport describes a case of megaloblastic anemia, which developed two years after \nstarting SASP and promptly recovered after its withdrawal and treatment with\nfolic acid and prednisolone. The doses of SASP prescribed for RA in Japan are\nless than those prescribed abroad. Megaloblastic anemia associated with SASP\ntreatment for RA is not usually detected in Japan. Currently, SASP is widely used\nand one of the key drugs in the treatment of RA. This case suggests that SASP\ntherapy in RA might result in megaloblastic anemia.\n\nPMID: 19110522  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

She noticed polyarthralgia 8 months prior to the\nadmission and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was made. Administration of\nsalazosulfapyridine (1.0 g/day) was started 6 months before the admission.\nComplete remission of rheumatoid arthritis was obtained in 2 months and blood\ncell counts showed normal values at that time. The results of laboratory tests\nincluded hemoglobin; 8.6 g/dl, white blood cell count; 1,900/mm3 with a\ndifferential of 19% neutrophils, 77% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes; platelets\nwere 21,000/mm3. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. There were\nreduced numbers of myelocytes, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes indicating\naplastic anemia. Salazosulfapyridine was discontinued. Prednisolone, anabolic\nsteroid and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were administrated. In \nspite of these therapy, recovery of peripheral blood cell counts have not been\nobserved and supporting therapy including red cell and platelets transfusion have\nbeen continued. To our knowledge, this is the first case report which describes\noccurrence of aplastic anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated by\nsalazosulfapyridine.\n\nPMID: 7553032  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Report on 7 cases, possible\ntreatment and review of the literature].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nLang B, Weber S, Maas D.\n\nWarm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare but typical\nextraintestinal complication of ulcerative colitis. Seven cases with this\ncondition are reported here and 24 further cases from the literature are\nreviewed. There were no essential differences between the two groups of patients \nwith respect to clinical and immuno-hematological findings. However, the\nintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs has led to a change in therapy and\nprognosis in recent years. Our observations suggest that treatment with steroids \nand azathioprine is to be recommended, with accompanying therapy of the\nunderlying disease. In patients failing to respond to this immunosuppressive\nregimen, splenectomy or surgical treatment of the affected intestines must be\nconsidered. For every patient with ulcerative colitis and hyperregenerative\nanemia the possibility of warm autoantibody formation must be ruled out by\nperforming the direct antiglobulin test.\n\nPMID: 2862702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A Heidelberg scanning laser ophthalmoscope was used for fundus\nfluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography. Retinal\nneovascularization was detected during the follow-up.\nRESULTS: Successful regression of retinal neovascularization was achieved after\nargon green laser panretinal photocoagulation in addition to oral steroid and\nsalazopyrine.\nCONCLUSION: Retinal vascular involvement is a rare ocular feature of Crohn's\ndisease and may result in retinal neovascularization that may necessitate prompt \nlaser photocoagulation.\n\nPMID: 12201349  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

With numerous differential diagnoses, an early accurate\ndiagnosis can be challenging. infectious causes are the most important to exclude\nin a timely manner and drug rash and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nis another differential diagnosis that should be considered in children. This\nhypersensitivity reaction is associated with multisystem involvement. Children\nwith underlying chronic diseases may have impairment of normal metabolic pathways\nand are also often on multiple medications. Therefore, drugs should always be\nconsidered in the aetiopathology of any new symptoms and signs. This case report \ninforms readers of the association of sulfasalazine and DRESS in an 11-year-old\nwith inflammatory bowel disease and discusses its pathogenesis and treatment.\nIncreased awareness of this disorder will hopefully lead to increased reporting\nand consequently illuminate the syndrome more clearly and help guide its\nprevention and treatment.\n\nPMID: 20546480  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We report here a case \nof mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder associated with primary\nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old female\nhad been treated with salazosulfapyridine and ursodesoxycholic acid becase of UC \nand PSC. After 7 years of treatment, laboratory data showed that the liver\nfunction took a turn for the worse, and the patient was admitted to our hospital \nfor further examination. Enhanced computed tomography and ultrasonography showed \nan enlarged gallbladder associated with wall thickening and diffuse papillary\nprotrusion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis and dilatation \nof the bile duct, which were compatible with PSC. Under the diagnosis of an early\ncarcinoma of the gallbladder, we performed simple cholecystectomy. The tumor\nshowed a papillary growth pattern located diffusely in the gallbladder with a\nmassive amount of mucin filling the gallbladder. Histologically, it was diagnosed\nas a papillary adenocarcinoma localized in the mucosal layer. To the best of our \nknowledge, this is the first case of mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder\nassociated with PSC and UC. PSC and UC patients should be regarded as a high-risk\ngroup not only for cholangiocarcinoma but also carcinoma of the gallbladder.\n\nPMID: 19096754  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In\ncase 1, the serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was decreased only temporarily by\nursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment and 34 months later, sulphasalazine was\nadded because of microscopic colitis. The enzyme level decreased with dual\ntherapy. Similarly, in case 3, first diagnosed as autoimmune hepatitis, the\ntranspeptidase levels remained elevated for 18 months during treatment with UDCA,\nprednisolone and mizoribin. The enzyme decreased only after a diagnosis of\nprimary sclerosing cholangitis complicated with ulcerative colitis was\nestablished and sulphasalazine was introduced. Case 2 also had Crohn's colitis\nand was put on UDCA and sulphasalazine from the start. The enzyme level was\nnormalized within 1 month and has remained normal for the following 5 years.\nLiver biopsies were analysed repeatedly in these three patients. In case 1,\nperiductal fibrosis remained unchanged while being treated by UDCA. There\nappeared to be no progression in liver cirrhosis in case 3 while being treated by\nUDCA, prednisolone, and mizoribin. In case 2, who has been treated with both UDCA\nand sulphasalazine from the start, periductal fibrosis and portal fibrosis were\nremarkably improved 45 months later. We suggest that sulphasalazine in addition\nto UDCA might be a viable treatment for children with primary sclerosing\ncholangitis.\n\nPMID: 9736177  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

X-ray examination revealed sclerosis of the right sacroiliac\njoint, and of the 6th lumbar vertebra. An NMR examination revealed a diffuse\nsignal loss in the region of the 6th lumbar vertebra. On account of the\nprogressive increase in liver transaminases in the serum, an ERCP was carried\nout, which confirmed the suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Severe\naxial arthritis and PSC with underlying clinically inactive ulcerative colitis\nwas diagnosed, and treatment with salazosulfapyridine and ursodeoxycholic acid\ninitiated. This led to freedom from pain within a matter of weeks and an\nappreciable reduction in serum cholestasis parameters.\n\nPMID: 7903077  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In most cases, this\ndisease is the result of reactivation and secondary hematogenous spread of a\nlatent infection. Although the suspected diagnosis is given by clinical\nmanifestations and analysis of ascitic fluid (lymphocytic predominance, albumin\ngradient between serum and ascitic fluid 1g/dl and adenosine deaminase\nconcentration > or = 39 U/L), microbiologic assessment is required for the\ndefinitive diagnosis. Mycobacterium bovis causes tuberculosis in animals.\nTransmission to humans is rare in developed areas, given that it usually occurs\nthrough ingestion of unpasteurized contaminated milk. We present a patient with\ncirrhosis who developed ascites caused by an exceptional infection in our\nsetting.\n\nPMID: 19577339  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We report a case of\ndisseminated mycobacterial infection, following BCG vaccination, in a child who\nlater developed tuberculosis. Functional tests and a novel diagnostic polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) assay, revealed a loss-of-function deletion in the IL12\ngene. Analysis of samples from the parents and siblings of the patient indicated \nan autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with varying degrees of phenotypic\nexpression in identical genotypes. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) therapy was\nassociated with marked clinical improvement. Biliary cirrhosis, a hitherto\nunreported complication of IL-12 deficiency, developed later and required liver\ntransplantation. A defect in the IL-12-IFN-gamma pathway should be suspected in\npatients presenting with multiple, repeated or persistent infection with\nintracellular bacteria. The diagnostic work-up and the immuno-genetic assay\ndescribed here can aid in the quick and reliable diagnosis of IL-12 deficiency\nresulting from genetic defects and its subsequent management.\n\nPMID: 18204084  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Given the clinical findings, and awaiting for the bacterial \nculture result, a triple treatment with tuberculostatics was started, but had to \nbe discontinued because of hepatic toxicity. After culture of cutaneous biopsy\nyielded micobaterium tuberculosis, treatment with streptomycin, rifampicin and\netambutol was restarted. Three weeks later, in spite of increasing hydrocortisone\ndose to 40 mg, adrenal insufficiency reappeared. Under the circumstances, we\nchose to continue rifampicin and double hydrocortisone dose. The case is of\nconcern because of the concurrency of three nowadays infrequent disorders:\ntuberculous ethiology adrenal insufficiency, cutaneous tuberculosis due to\nmycobacterium bovis and primary adrenal insufficiency due to rifampicin\ntreatment, the latter resolved after increasing hydrocortisone dose.\n\nPMID: 18279000  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the guinea pigs an\nintradermal dose of PHA-P produced erythema and induration with a maximal\nresponse at 24 hours after the injection. Histologically it was characterized by \nperivascular infiltration of lymphoid cells in the dermis and subcutis, being\nsimilar to that of tuberculin (PPD) skin reaction. PHA skin reaction, however,\nshowed some difference from that of PPD in the initial cellular response in that \nthe former was composed of small mononuclear cells and granulocytes with rapid\ndevelopment and the latter was composed of large mononuclear cells (macrophages) \nand granulocytes with slow development. Intradermal injection of 1:1000 dilution \nof PHA-P produced a similar erythema in man. In 39 of 59 patients with connective\ntissue diseases, the results of the in vivo (skin test) and in vitro (lymphocyte \ntransformation) response to PHA correlated well. In the 59 patients, the\nincidence of the positive rate of the PHA tests (55.9%) was significantly higher \nthan that of the DNCB test (33.9%) and of the PPD test (23.7%). These\nobservations suggest that the PHA skin test has properties of delayed\nhypersensitivity and is highly sensitive and that it may be a useful measure of\ncell-mediated immunity.\n\nPMID: 371848  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-function has been described as a mechanism\nof drug resistance in autoimmune patients. P-gp function can in vitro be\ninhibited by cyclosporine A (CSA) and verapamil; moreover, P-gp reduction by CSA \nin systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated.\nHere, P-gp function before and after CSA administration in three psoriatic\narthritis (PsA) patients, who developed a resistance to MTX/SSA, has been\nevaluated. P-gp function on patient cells was analyzed by measuring the changes\nin rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) fluorescence after verapamil incubation. CSA treatment \nresulted in good clinical outcome that was related with a significant P-gp\nfunction reduction at CD3+ and CD8+ levels. In addition to its immunosuppressive \nactivity, CSA results may also be related to MTX/SSA effect restoration through\nP-gp inhibition. This is the first time that CSA has been demonstrated as being\nable to revert MTX/SSA resistance in PsA.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As a rule, drugs and dosages are minimized in these patients. Among\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, cyclosporine and sulphasalazine are\npreferred. Methotrexate and leflunomide are strictly contraindicated and must be \nwithdrawn 3 months or 2 years, respectively, before a pregnancy is planned.\nPsoriatic arthritis may be treated during pregnancy with glucocorticosteroids,\nespecially with prednisone or prednisolone.

Two weeks after starting treatment, a high degree, subcontinuous fever\noccurred, together with systemic discomfort, fatigue, headache, and ultimately a \nmoderate wakefulness impairment. Upon admission to the hospital, a malar rash\nbecame evident. Modest notes of hepatotoxicity were also evident. All of the\nsymptoms suddenly resolved after SSZ withdrawal. The markers of hepatitis become \nnegative just 2 months later. It is interesting to note that after dismissal, in \norder to counteract the severe arthritic conditions and the presence of a type 2 \ndiabetes, a combined therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporin had to be used,\nwith no renal or hepatic side effects and remarkable therapeutic effects. No\nmarkers of autoimmunity were found in this patient. The chronology and the\nclinical events here described may confirm the hypothesis of a idiosyncratic\nreaction to SSZ, closely resembling a rare, sometimes irreversible, condition\nknown as "the 3 week sulphasalazine syndrome".\n\nPMID: 14976471  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis, eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis.\nTreatment consisted of withdrawing the two drugs and topical steroids. The\nclinical signs regressed in 6 days. An increase in eosinophilia and hepatic\ncytolysis was observed until the tenth day, after which the trend reversed.\nLaboratory parameters were normal on the twentieth day. One month later,\nphotopatch testing was performed. A patch test with sulfanilamide irradiated with\nUVA was positive. Clinical and laboratory findings were highly suggestive of drug\nhypersensitivity syndrome. The positive result from the UVA photopatch test with \nsulfanilamide suggests that sulfasalazopyridine was involved in the occurrence of\nhypersensitivity syndrome in our patient.

In the last ten years, there have been a few rare case\nreports of physical trauma precipitating psoriasic arthritis. We observed two\nsuch cases following an occupational accident discovered one and a half year and \ntwo and a half year after onset of the first clinical manifestations. In the\nfirst case, a 43-year-old man had a fracture of the right calcaneus in March\n1991. He was treated with nailing and also required emergency surgery of the\nposterior tibial artery. The tibiotarsal joint was normal radiologically. Pain\npersisted after treatment and in 1993 he presented with psoriasis of the scalp\nand several other localizations together with Hallopeau's acrodermatitis continua\nof the ankle, pathognomonic for psoriasic arthritis. Salazosufapyridin was given.\nThe second case was a 50-year-old man who had major pain in both wrists\nimmediately after falling on the palm of his hands in 1992. Bilateral carpal\ntunnel syndrome developed which did not respond well to surgery. In 1993, he\ndeveloped inflammatory synovitis and also had psoriasis mainly located at the\nelbows. Immunological tests were negative. Cortisone and salazosulfapyridin were \nnot particularly effective and the patient later developed arthritis of the hip\nand ankle joints. Physicians should be aware of physical trauma as a causative\nfactor in psoriasic arthritis due to the potential legal implications. Criteria\nfor imputability are: single major physical trauma, absence of clinical signs\nprior to the trauma, continuous clinical course, first signs occurring then\npredominating at the joint exposed to trauma. The pathophysiology of this type of\narthritis is not well understood. Deep Koebner's phenomena could be involved.\nActivation of substance P has also been hypothesized.\n\nPMID: 8728887  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The patient had no\nprevious history of tuberculosis. Because of persistent inflammation and painful \nswelling of the epididymides and testes, the patient underwent bilateral\norchiectomy. This case demonstrates the late adverse effects that can occur after\nintravesical BCG therapy, which in our patient ended in surgical removal of both \ngonads.\n\nPMID: 15667898  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We report here a case \nof mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder associated with primary\nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old female\nhad been treated with salazosulfapyridine and ursodesoxycholic acid becase of UC \nand PSC. After 7 years of treatment, laboratory data showed that the liver\nfunction took a turn for the worse, and the patient was admitted to our hospital \nfor further examination. Enhanced computed tomography and ultrasonography showed \nan enlarged gallbladder associated with wall thickening and diffuse papillary\nprotrusion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis and dilatation \nof the bile duct, which were compatible with PSC. Under the diagnosis of an early\ncarcinoma of the gallbladder, we performed simple cholecystectomy. The tumor\nshowed a papillary growth pattern located diffusely in the gallbladder with a\nmassive amount of mucin filling the gallbladder. Histologically, it was diagnosed\nas a papillary adenocarcinoma localized in the mucosal layer. To the best of our \nknowledge, this is the first case of mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder\nassociated with PSC and UC. PSC and UC patients should be regarded as a high-risk\ngroup not only for cholangiocarcinoma but also carcinoma of the gallbladder.\n\nPMID: 19096754  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The diagnosis was confirmed by macroscopic and\nhistopathological examination of lung tissue removed by surgery. Subsequent\nbacteriological examination showed the infection to have been caused by BCG. The \npossibility is discussed of whether the condition had developed from a metastatic\nlesion following BCG vaccination, or was the result of an aerogenic infection\nduring the production of BCG vaccine. The simultaneous development of the\ntuberculous condition and the tumour is remarkable but is not discussed further. \nThe requirements of WHO when signs of tuberculosis are found in a worker in a BCG\nlaboratory were complied with in this instance, but it was not considered\nnecessary to change the routine procedure in the BCG Department.\n\nPMCID: PMC2366676\nPMID: 340075  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Puusepa 8,\n51014 Tartu, Estonia. tonu.ratsep@kliinikum.ee\n\nBACKGROUND CONTEXT: Postoperative spondylodiscitis (PSD) is a known complication \nof lumbar disc surgery. The etiology of the disease is usually bacterial, but\nseveral uncommon infectious agents have also been described; however, there are\nno reports about postoperative colonization with Mycobacterium bovis bacille\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin after lumbar discectomy.\nPURPOSE: To describe the case of PSD caused by M. bovis BCG, and to discuss\ndiagnostic and therapeutic interventions as well as possible pathogenic\nmechanisms of the disease.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case report and review of the literature.\nMETHODS: A 31-year-old man was operated on because of L4-L5 lumbar disc\nherniation. Two months later, the patient presented with gradual increase of back\npain, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed PSD. He started to receive\nantibacterial treatment and was reoperated on because of progressive neurological\ndeficits due to epidural abscess. Neurological status improved, but a fistula\ndeveloped with intermittent pus drainage from the operative scar.\nRESULTS: Microbiological cultures were repeatedly obtained from the pus, but all \nthe initial stains and cultures were negative. Four months after the reoperation,\nthe culture for M. bovis BCG from the pus appeared to be positive. The patient\nreceived antituberculosis regimen, including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and\nofloxacin. The clinical symptoms resolved, and antituberculosis treatment was\ndiscontinued after 14 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium bovis BCG must be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of PSD. Microbiological analysis and radiological studies are vital\ncomponents in diagnosis; if there is any suspicion of BCG osteomyelitis, proper\ndiagnostic and therapeutic management must be instituted without delay to avoid\nan unfavorable outcome.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Complications after\nintravesical BCG immunotherapy are extremely rare. We report an iliac muscle\nabscess due to M bovis that developed 4 years after intravesical BCG therapy for \nbladder cancer.

Past\nmedical history revealed transurethral resection of bladder cancer followed by\nmultiple intravesical BCG instillation 12 years ago. Imaging studies of the\nthoracolumbar spine showed osteolysis of the L3 and L4 vertebrae and the\nassociated intervertebral disc space, and a large soft tissue mass with signal\nabnormalities suggesting of an abscess. CT-guided needle biopsy showed\nMycobacterium bovis infection. A triple anti-tuberculous chemotherapy regimen\nincluding isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol was administered for 12 months.\nSurgical treatment included drainage of the abscess and L2-L5 spinal\ninstrumentation and fusion. Intravesical BCG therapy may be complicated by late\ndisseminated disease to the bone even many years after initial BCG therapy.\nPatients having BCG therapy should be closely evaluated thereafter for the\npossibility of hematogenous spread of mycobacteria to distant sites.\n\nPMID: 19303342  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The prevalence of tuberculosis in Taiwan is higher than the\nWorld Health Organization standard. However, reports of M. bovis infection are\nrare. A 47-year-old male had the habit of drinking uncooked fresh deer's blood\nand unpasteurized deer's milk. He suffered from acute abdominal pain and\nunderwent emergency laparotomy. Pathology demonstrated tuberculosis enteritis\nwith colon perforation. The molecular diagnosis by nested polymerase chain\nreaction assay and single-strand conformation polymorphism assay showed M. bovis \ninfection in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). Our results suggest that the most likely portal of entry of M. bovis is\nthe gastrointestinal rather than the respiratory tract. Ingested M. bovis from\nunpasteurized deer's milk probably entered the mucosal macrophages of the\nintestine and then the draining mesenteric lymph nodes. As immunity declined,\nbacilli from the mesenteric lymph nodes disseminated to other organs and into the\nCSF.\n\nPMID: 15253472  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

It is still a widely used\nanti-inflammatory agent especially in the treatment of rheumatologic disorders\nand inflammatory bowel diseases. Most of its side effects are benign, tolerable, \nand dose dependent, but less common severe systemic reactions have also been\nrevealed.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was\nadmitted to emergency service because of status epilepticus. Hepatitis and\nmyelotoxicity were also present after laboratory investigations. The patient was \non sulfasalazine treatment for 3 weeks with a daily dose of 2g. Cranial magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral periventricular and subcortical\nlesions in the white matter of especially temporal and occipital regions.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed very high protein level (564 mg/L). \nAfter discontinuation of treatment, the clinical, CSF, and MRI findings regressed\nrapidly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Side effects of sulfasalazine include neurotoxicity such as status\nepilepticus, cranial MRI lesions, and CSF abnormalities that were diagnosed in\nour patient after excluding other etiologic factors causing encephalitis.\n\nPMID: 19050416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Ulcerative colitis was diagnosed according\nto endoscopic and histologic findings. She was treated with prednisolone and\nsulfasalazine, and her symptoms disappeared after 1 month. Sulfasalazine therapy \nwas continued for 3 months, and the patient's condition remained stable for 4\nyears. Recently, she was admitted with abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and\nmelena. She was again treated with prednisolone and intravenous\nhyperalimentation, but her symptoms did not improve. Colonoscopy showed multiple \nulcers with bleeding and polyposis and severe edema in the colon. In addition,\nshe had a high blood endotoxin concentration (38.0 pg/ml; normal < 9.8 pg/ml).\nShe underwent polymyxin B-immobilized fiber (PMX-F) hemoperfusion therapy twice. \nAfter 2 weeks, her symptoms resolved completely, colonoscopy showed disappearance\nof the edema, revascularization of the mucosa, and improvement of the ulcers, and\nblood endotoxin concentration decreased to 5.0 pg/ml.

The patient, a 70-year-old farmer, with\nmetastatic malignant melanoma was treated intralesionally with oil-attached\nBCG-CWS or was given intradermally with oil-attached BCG-CWS together with\nirradiated autologous and allogeneic tumor cells. Four months after the start of \nthe immunotherapy with oil-attached BCG-CWS, Primary tumor and metastatic\ninguinal lymph nodes regressed markedly without any significant complications.\nLymphocytosis in the peripheral blood was usually observed after injection of\noil-attached BCG-CWS.\n\nPMID: 1102379  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient was treated for one year by an\nassociation of chemotherapy and lyophilized B.C.G. (Pasteur Institute). Aside\nfrom the rarity of the localization the importance of this observation resides in\nthe discovery of B.C.G. after auramine staining in the liver suggesting that the \nhepatic lesions were linked to the in situ presence of mycobacteria.\n\nPMID: 764894  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S"\n1. Pediatr Emerg Care. 2010 Feb;26(2):146-8. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0b013e3181d018bc.\n\nSalicylic acid ingestion leading to esophageal stricture.\n\nWaasdorp Hurtado CE(1), Kramer RE.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Children's Hospital, Denver, CO 80045, USA. waasdorp.christine@tchden.org\n\nAccidental ingestion of caustic substances (acid and alkali) occurs more\nfrequently in children than in adults. The subsequent injury varies from minimal \nto severe, with perforation and even death as potential complications. Several\nfactors have been shown to mediate the severity of injury, including the pH,\nconcentration and physical state of the ingested substance, tissue contact time, \nand quantity (volume) of the ingested material. Liquids with a pH of less than 2 \n(acidic) or a pH of greater than 12 (alkali) are considered to be extremely\ncorrosive and hold the greatest risk for injury. Esophageal injury after caustic \ningestion is endoscopically graded with a score of 0 for no injury to IIIb for\nsignificant circumferential injury with ulcers and necrosis. Ingestion of either \na strong alkali or acid has been documented to result in esophageal necrosis and \nulcers (grade IIIb). Alkali ingestions occur more frequently because of their\npresence in daily life (detergents, degreasers) and therefore have more reports\nof injury. Despite more than 8200 documented cases of topical salicylic acid\ningestions annually in US children younger than 19 years, there are no reported\ncases of salicylic acid resulting in gastrointestinal pathology. We report 2\ncases of salicylic acid ingestion resulting in esophageal strictures. Both\npatients had more significant injury than anticipated given their initial\nclinical presentations. Given our recent experience, we recommend close follow-up\nand evaluation for strictures in patients with exposure to salicylic acid.\n\nPMID: 20145508  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

He subsequently presented with\nfull-thickness burn injuries to the soles of his feet. When the patient developed\nacute coronary insufficiency, immediate surgery could not be performed. He was\ntherefore treated conservatively with salicylic acid and Silverol cream.\nSpontaneous closure of the wounds was achieved in the course of 2 months.\n\nPMID: 8982548  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub\n2012 Aug 14.\n\n[Local salicylate transcutaneous absorption: an unrecognized risk of severe\nintoxication: a case report].\n\n[Article in French]\n\nOualha M(1), Dupic L, Bastian C, Bergounioux J, Bodemer C, Lesage F.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Service de r\xc3\xa9animation p\xc3\xa9diatrique et n\xc3\xa9onatale, universit\xc3\xa9 Ren\xc3\xa9 Descartes,\nh\xc3\xb4pital Necker Enfants-Malades, Assistance publique-H\xc3\xb4pitaux de Paris, 149, rue\nde S\xc3\xa8vres, 75015 Paris, France. mehdi.oualha@nck.aphp.fr\n\nINTRODUCTION: Although rare, salicylate intoxication through the skin should not \nbe ignored as it can be severely life-threatening. We describe an original case\nof accidental poisoning with salicylates topically applied to the scalp of a\n6-week-old infant.\nCLINICAL REPORT: A 6-week-old infant, with no prior history, was admitted to the \npediatric intensive care unit for treatment of severe disorders of consciousness \nassociated with significant tachypnea. Laboratory results revealed metabolic\nacidosis with elevated anion gap, ketonuria, and normal glycemia. Initial\nassessment ruled out the hypothesis of accidental ingestion of salicylates.\nHowever, the presence of salicylic acid derivatives in organic acid\nchromatography, confirmed by plasma salicylate levels at 580 mg/L, ultimately\nre-established the diagnosis. Further inquiry retrospectively highlighted the\nprolonged topical application in occlusion (3 days) of an extemporaneous\npreparation containing 23% salicylic acid on the scalp. The course after urine\nalkalinization was rapidly favorable without sequelae.\nCOMMENT AND CONCLUSIONS: Salicylate intoxication is potentially lethal,\nparticularly in infants under 12 months of age. The vast majority of these\nintoxications result from accidental ingestion. The present observation\nunderscores the original and undescribed risk of intoxication due to a localized \napplication to the scalp. In the presence of warning symptoms, salicylate\npoisoning should be investigated, including topical application of salicylic\nacid, even if localized. Careful attention should be paid to following the\nindications of use of this product in terms of concentration, characteristics of \nthe infant, and exposed skin. The use of extended topical application of\nsalicylic acid in concentrations greater than 3% should be avoided.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The dermatology service was consulted\nfor treatment suggestions of a presumed diagnosis of chronic tinea capitis. Three\ncourses of oral griseofulvin during the past 2 years failed to resolve the\npatient's chronic scalp dermatosis. Scalp lesions first began about 2 years\nearlier after hospitalization for placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump. The \npatient was unable to care for her scalp due to her cerebral palsy, and her\nmother interpreted the scalp condition as infectious. No routine shampoo care,\nscalp care, or topical treatment was performed for more than 1 1/2 years. The\nmother felt that touching the patient's scalp might cause pain and noted that the\nmajority of her time was spent concentrating on more critical medical issues.\nPhysical examination revealed coalescing hyperkeratotic plaques extending\ndorsally from the anterior hairline to the occipital scalp with small flecks of\nkeratinous debris throughout the remaining hair (Figure 1). The plate-like\nplaques were devoid of hair, except at a few fissures where a few tufts of hair\nemerged. No cervical lymph nodes were appreciated on palpation. Treatment was\ninitiated with compresses consisting of large warm water-soaked towels 4 times\ndaily. Three times a day, a nursing staff applied 5% salicylic acid in olive oil \nto the scalp under a shower cap for approximately 1 hour. Over the following 2\ndays, a significant reduction in keratinous debris was appreciated. Within 2\nweeks, the bulk of the plaques had been removed (Figure 2). At 6-week follow-up, \nthe underlying scalp showed areas of fibrosis and possible scarring with a few\nemerging tufts of hair. On the basis of history and response to treatment with\nsalicylic acid and routine scalp care, the patient was diagnosed with an\nunusually severe case of dermatosis neglecta.\n\nPMID: 22324178  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two\nphenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations\nwithin the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT\ninterval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial\nfeatures, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of\nTS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have\ncortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted\nmutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS\nassociated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene\nmutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand\nboth the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nPMCID: PMC3319791\nPMID: 22106044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The extent of the ototoxic salicylate impact is increased by\ndiabetes, renal insufficiency, and alcoholism.\nPATIENT: This study presents a case report of a female patient who suffered a\nrepeated, symmetric, pancochlear, reversible inner ear impairment after two\ntreatments with salicylate containing ointment for psoriasis. The correlation of \nthe salicylate therapy with the observed inner ear lesions is obvious due to the \nclose interval between these incidences and to the audiologic criteria typical\nfor salicylate intoxication.\nCONCLUSION: Audiologic controls should be carried out during extended local\napplication of salicylate containing ointment.\n\nPMID: 9333282  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Until now, few cases of transcutaneous\nsalicylate intoxication have been reported in the literature. Our case report is \nabout a 5-year-old girl with lamellar ichthyosis and an acute salicylate\ntranscutaneous intoxication after the application of a skin ointment. The child\nhad a fever, hyperpnoea with respiratory alkalosis, comatose state and oculogyric\ncrisis. We would like to emphasize the danger of applying salicylic acid in\nchildren with extensive skin diseases and, therefore, it is advisable to measure \nthe plasma salicylic levels so as to prevent eventual salicylate toxicity.\n\nPMID: 9099329  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

High-dose\nacetaminophen has been reported to provoke bronchospasm in aspirin-sensitive\nasthmatic patients.\nCASE HISTORY: We report an asthmatic adolescent female who had anaphylaxis with\n650 mg acetaminophen after tolerating 325-mg doses for years. She subsequently in\nsequence had urticaria with aspirin and ibuprofen, and anaphylaxis with sodium\nsalicylate. She was then challenged with acetaminophen, 325 mg orally.\nRESULTS: Approximately 30 minutes after acetaminophen challenge, she developed\nrhinoconjunctivitis, urticaria, pruritus, cough, and bronchospasm reversed with\nantihistamines and bronchodilators.\nCONCLUSIONS: Aspirin sensitivity has not frequently been described in younger age\ngroups. This patient also had several unusual features in that she presented\nfirst with sensitivity to acetaminophen that was then followed by aspirin\nsensitivity. She had urticaria with both aspirin and sodium salicylate; she had\ncombined pulmonary and cutaneous reactions to both acetaminophen and aspirin,\nwhich are rarely described; and she had anaphylaxis with low-dose acetaminophen.\n\nPMID: 8970436  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nhistopathology and ultrastructural pathology were compared to that in two cases\nof Reye's syndrome which were selected because they had been treated with\nsalicylates and had comparable serum salicylate concentrations at the time of\nliver biopsy. Liver biopsy specimens from the cases of salicylate intoxication\nwere nearly normal by light microscopy. Lipid accumulation was minimal, and the\ncontent of glycogen and succinic acid dehydrogenase activity was normal.\nMitochondria and peroxisomes appeared normal. Light and electron microscopy of\nliver specimens from the two cases of Reye's syndrome revealed swollen\nhepatocytes with microvesicular fat and central nuclei. Glycogen content and\nsuccinic acid dehydrogenase activity were diminished. All hepatocyte mitochondria\nwere enlarged, pleomorphic, and had an expanded matrix and no mitochondrial dense\nbodies. The histopathology and ultrastructural pathology of liver biopsy\nspecimens in salicylate intoxication were different from those in Reye's\nsyndrome. In children in whom the diagnosis of Reye's syndrome is obscure, liver \nbiopsy with electron microscopic examination is necessary for definitive\ndiagnosis.\n\nPMID: 6745858  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2011 \nJul 14.\n\nDisseminated BCG infection mimicking metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in an\nimmunodeficient child with a novel hypomorphic NEMO mutation.\n\nImamura M(1), Kawai T, Okada S, Izawa K, Takachi T, Iwabuchi H, Yoshida S,\nHosokai R, Kanegane H, Yamamoto T, Umezu H, Nishikomori R, Heike T, Uchiyama M,\nImai C.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Pediatrics, Department of Homeostatic Regulation and Development,\nNiigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757\nAsahimachi-Dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.\n\nBACKGROUND: Nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency is a\ndevelopmental and immunological disorder. The genetic and phenotypic correlation \nhas been described.\nMETHODS: We report a unique clinical presentation and the identification of a\nnovel missense mutation in the NEMO gene in a 3-year-old boy with bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin (BCG) infection.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and abnormal\nanti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers, suggestive of EBV-related diseases\nincluding chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, or\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although the biopsy specimen from a nasopharyngeal\nlesion was initially diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, this was changed to\ndisseminated BCG infection involving the nasopharynx, multiple systemic lymph\nnodes, and brain. A novel mutation (designated D311E) in the NEMO gene, located\nin the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain, was identified as the underlying\ncause of the immunodeficiency. Impaired immune responses which are characteristic\nof patients with NEMO deficiency were demonstrated. The patient underwent\nsuccessful unrelated bone marrow transplantation at 4.9\xc2\xa0years of age.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of the NUB domain in host defense \nagainst mycobacteria. The unique presenting features in our patient indicate that\na hypomorphic NEMO mutation can be associated with atypical pathological findings\nof the epithelial tissues in patients with BCG infection.\n\nPMID: 21755389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We report here a case \nof mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder associated with primary\nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old female\nhad been treated with salazosulfapyridine and ursodesoxycholic acid becase of UC \nand PSC. After 7 years of treatment, laboratory data showed that the liver\nfunction took a turn for the worse, and the patient was admitted to our hospital \nfor further examination. Enhanced computed tomography and ultrasonography showed \nan enlarged gallbladder associated with wall thickening and diffuse papillary\nprotrusion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis and dilatation \nof the bile duct, which were compatible with PSC. Under the diagnosis of an early\ncarcinoma of the gallbladder, we performed simple cholecystectomy. The tumor\nshowed a papillary growth pattern located diffusely in the gallbladder with a\nmassive amount of mucin filling the gallbladder. Histologically, it was diagnosed\nas a papillary adenocarcinoma localized in the mucosal layer. To the best of our \nknowledge, this is the first case of mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder\nassociated with PSC and UC. PSC and UC patients should be regarded as a high-risk\ngroup not only for cholangiocarcinoma but also carcinoma of the gallbladder.\n\nPMID: 19096754  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

His generation includes five similarly\naffected male members. A translocation chromosome is segregating in this\nNewfoundland kindred. The proband's mother and grandmother have normal skin and\nare of normal intelligence. From his carrier mother, the proband inherited an X\nshort arm (Xp) to Y long arm (Yq) translocation chromosome, with the entire Y\nshort arm and the X short arm terminal segment deleted (Xp223-pter). His cells\nare completely deficient in STS activity, confirming assignment of the STS locus \nto Xp223-pter. Effective management of his ichthyosis included treatment with 6% \nsalicylic acid gel under plastic occlusion and removal of the scales by\nscrubbing.\n\nPMID: 3864397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S'\n1. Clin Nephrol. 2009 Jan;71(1):74-9.\n\nProteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-(PR3-ANCA) positive necrotizing \nglomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment.\n\nMiura N(1), Aoyama R, Kitagawa W, Yamada H, Nishikawa K, Imai H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi\nMedical University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.\n\nA 59-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes, pleural effusion,\neosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine\ntreatment. Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing\nglomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. Proteinase\n3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA \nunits (EU) in sera (normal range less than 10 EU), myeloperoxidase-ANCA was\nnegative. PR3-ANCA titer was 250 and 1,070 EU in pleural effusions on right and\nleft side, respectively. Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted \nin improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of C-reactive protein and\nvolume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA\ntiter rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the\npleural effusion remained. One month after steroid therapy, the pleural effusion \ndisappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later. This case suggests\nthat sulphasalazine can induce PR3-ANCA-positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis.\n\nPMID: 19203554  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub\n2012 May 25.\n\nTwo cases of tuberculosis with multiple drug hypersensitivity after drug-induced \nhypersensitivity syndrome.\n\nSekine A(1), Saito T, Ito S, Tsunoda Y, Sumazaki Y, Tanaka T, Takoi H, Lin SY,\nYatagai Y, Hayasihara K.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization,\nIbaraki-Higashi National Hospital, Terunuma 825, Tokai-mura, Naka-gun, Ibaraki,\nJapan. Akimasa.Sekine@gmail.com\n\nHere, we report 2 cases of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) caused\nby salazosulfapyridine and allopurinol during tuberculosis treatment. Both\npatients also developed multiple drug hypersensitivity (MDH) to several\nantituberculosis drugs that were used at around the period of DIHS onset, and\nthus, the treatment could not be successfully completed. Our cases show that MDH \ncan easily occur after development of DIHS. Considering that treatment for\ntuberculosis requires long-term management with several drugs, it is important to\nrefrain from administering drugs that can cause DIHS during tuberculosis\ntreatment.\n\n2012 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

We describe a 12-year-old boy who\ndeveloped desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and hepatic cirrhosis several\nyears following the onset of ulcerative colitis. The restrictive lung disease\nprogressed despite cessation of sulfasalazine and initiation of corticosteroid\ntherapy. We discuss a variety of bronchopulmonary complications of IBD and their \nassociation with sulfasalazine.\n\nPMID: 2863342  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

At 6 months after the last dose, he developed fever, weight loss\nand malaise. He had an extensive negative workup at an outside hospital and was\ntreated empirically with ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks. The fever resolved but\nreturned months later and he was readmitted with pancytopenia, elevated alkaline \nphosphatase and ground glass opacities on the chest CT. Bone marrow and liver\nbiopsies showed non-caseating granulomas and were negative for acid-fast bacillus\n(AFB) and fungal stains. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex PCR of the bone\nmarrow was negative. Owing to the high clinical suspicion of disseminated BCG\ninfection, the patient was treated empirically. After 9 weeks of incubation, the \nbone marrow AFB culture grew Mycobacterium bovis. Within 2 months of treatment\nhis symptoms resolved and his laboratory results normalised.\n\nPMID: 23576657  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In this report a patient who developed fatal\ndisseminated tuberculosis caused by M. bovis BCG strain was presented. One year\nold male patient with the previous history of recurrent lower respiratory tract\ninfection, was admitted to the hospital with the complaints of fever, cough and\ndiarrhea continuing for 20 days. There was no family history of tuberculosis or\nhistory of contact with a tuberculosis case. Physical examination of the case\nrevealed growth retardation and reticular and reticulonodular infiltration was\ndetected in his chest X-ray. The results of sweat test, cystic fibrosis gene\nmutation analysis and metabolic screening tests were normal. Since fever\ncontinued and infiltrations persisted in the chest X-ray despite antibiotic\ntherapy, PPD test was applied and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were investigated in\nhis gastric aspirate and stool samples for three consecutive days. PPD test was\nnegative and no AFB were detected in the microscopic examination of the clinical \nsamples. However, growth in Lowenstein-Jensen medium was detected in the stool\nsample on the 38th day of incubation. The antimycobacterial susceptibility\ntesting performed at BACTEC MGIT (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube) 960 system\n(Becton-Dickinson, USA) revealed that the isolate was susceptible to rifampin,\nisoniazid, streptomicin and ethambutol. Since the isolates did not grow at PNB\n(para-nitro benzoic acid) medium and niacin and nitrate activities were negative,\nspoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing) was performed and DR loci\ncharacteristic for M. bovis BCG strain were detected. However, the patient died 2\nweeks before the culture results were obtained. The effective use of\nmycobacteriology laboratories and cooperation between laboratory and clinics\nprovide advantages in the early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis cases,\ndecreasing the morbidity and the mortality.\n\nPMID: 20549966  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Clinically, an infantile kala-azar\nor lymphoma/leukemia was suspected. However, after thorough clinical and\nparaclinical investigations, the case was diagnosed as a disseminated BCG\ninfection. The child died 2 weeks after starting antituberculosis treatment.\nAutopsy revealed diffuse histiocytic infiltration in the liver, spleen, and\nmesenteric lymph nodes, which were loaded with acid-fast bacilli. Three\ninteresting findings were noticed in this case: circulating monocytes in the\nperipheral blood were loaded with ghost acid-fast bacilli; bone marrow smears\nrevealed numerous Gaucher cell-like macrophages loaded with negative images of\nMycobacterium tuberculi; and there was extensive marrow necrosis. These findings \nhave not been previously reported in the literature.\n\nPMID: 15701985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A total of 220 patients have been included in a review of local and\nsystemic side effects associated with BCG immunotherapy. The majority of side\neffects are mild and self limiting, but potentially life threatening\ncomplications can arise with BCG immunotherapy. These systemic side effects\ninclude pneumonitis/hepatitis and systemic BCG infection. Recommendations are\ngiven for the use and administration of BCG, and if these rules are correctly\napplied, BCG may be administered safely, and with confidence.\n\nPMID: 1396946  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Neth J Med. 1999 Feb;54(2):70-2.\n\nSwelling of hand and forearm caused by Mycobacterium bovis.\n\ndu Buf-Vereijken PW(1), van der Ven AJ, Meis JF, Lemmens JA, van der Meer JW.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of General Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The\nNetherlands.\n\nA 75-year-old native Dutch farmer presented with a painless swelling of his right\nhand extending into his forearm, accompanied by general malaise and low grade\nfever. His medical history revealed coxitis tuberculosa in 1954 and injury of the\nsame hand in 1978. His present swelling appeared to be caused by Mycobacterium\nbovis, probably due to endogenous reactivation. Whether the mycobacteria reached \nthe hand hematogenously or were directly inoculated at the time of injury of his \nhand in 1978 remains unclear.\n\nPMID: 10079681  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Int J Hematol. 2004 Dec;80(5):463-6.\n\nExperience with the use of salazosulfapyridine for intractable diarrhea after\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nMoriguchi N(1), Isokawa S, Ando A, Miyata H.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Pediatrics, Sakai Hospital, Kinki University School of Medicine,\nOsaka, Japan. naohiko@sakai.med.kindai.ac.jp\n\nWe encountered 2 children with intractable diarrhea after allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). In both cases, salazosulfapyridine\n(SASP) was administered to treat the diarrhea. One patient was a 14-year-old male\nwith acute myelogenous leukemia who received SCT from a related HLA-identical\ndonor. The leukemia recurred early, and a second SCT from the same donor was\nperformed approximately half a year later. Because intestinal graft-versus-host\ndisease (GVHD) was observed, steroids and octreotide were administered, but the\nsymptoms were not improved. Thereafter, SASP was administered, and the symptoms\nremitted 9 days later. The other patient was a 12-year-old male with chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia who received SCT from an unrelated HLA-identical donor.\nDiarrhea and abdominal pain developed early after engraftment and did not respond\nto either steroids or tacrolimus. Oral administration of SASP was initiated on\nday 236, and the diarrhea remitted 4 days later without recurrence thereafter.\nSASP may be effective in children for the digestive system symptoms of chronic\nGVHD.\n\nPMID: 15646661  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A skin biopsy showed hydropic degeneration of keratinocytes and\nlymphocytic infiltrate. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated an increased number\nof macrophages with hemophagocytosis. Although serologic tests for Epstein-Barr\nvirus (EBV) indicated a previous infection, EBV deoxyribonucleic acid was\ndetected in her serum by polymerase chain reaction. Cessation of sulfasalazine\nand administration of steroids led to dramatic improvement. This case illustrates\nthat the hemophagocytic syndrome associated with reactivation of EBV can occur as\npart of drug hypersensitivity reactions in RA patients taking sulfasalazine.\n\nPMID: 17952482  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sulfa drugs can cause a wide range of\nallergic and hypersensitivity reactions and occasionally can lead to a fulminant \nillness. In the case under discussion the patient had hepatotoxicity, skin rash, \nfever, and peripheral blood atypical lymphocytosis. Initial impressions suggested\nthe possibility of a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. Flow cytometry of\nperipheral blood and a bone marrow biopsy provided clear evidence for a reactive,\npolyclonal process as opposed to a malignant disorder. Cessation of the offending\ndrug and administration of steroids led to dramatic improvement. This case\nillustrates that drug hypersensitivity reactions can be manifested by an extreme \nlymphocytoid leukemoid reaction.\n\nPMID: 13680174  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

So we then\nchose the combined treatment of intralesional BCG and intravenous\nbeta-Interferon. Monthly intravenous administration of beta-Interferon has\nreached a total of 8,000,000 I/U, while the BCG has been inoculated\nintralesionally in the submucosa in doses of 0.1 ml after observing the negative \nresult of the PPD test. Our aim was to achieve double immunological stimulation\nby combining two drugs that are often used separately with satisfactory results. \nBefore and after every therapy cycle, the immunological status was established,\nand showed a small but constant and permanent increase in T-lymphocytes, both\nhelper and suppressor. Histological results before and after therapy and\nimmunological responses are reported, and the case distinguishes itself by its\nbrilliant results.\n\nPMID: 2667811  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Treatment consisted of aneurysm excision, in situ\nprosthetic graft placement, and antituberculous medications.

He died with widespread miliary\ngranulomas, most likely representing disseminated BCG infection. However, at\nautopsy, the patient was found to have a minimal tumor burden and only a single\nfocus of visceral metastatic malignant melanoma. In view of the clinically\ndocumented aggressive nature of this patient's disease, the arrested growth of\nhis tumors is best attributed to the beneficial effect of BCG immunotherapy.\n\nPMID: 3532854  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Metoclopramide was used as an\nantiemetic. During the second therapy cycle sudden severe vascular collapse with \nincreasing hepatomegaly and signs of acute hepatic failure occurred leading to\ndeath after two days. At necropsy a Budd-Chiari syndrome with thombosed hepatic\nveins and congestive liver parenchyma necroses was found. The cause was\nhyperergic endophlebitis combined with severe infiltration of the vascular walls \nby eosinophilic granulocytes. In association with 5 more similar cases from other\nclinics (personal communications) this picture must be assumed to be a\ncomplication of dacarbazine treatment.\n\nPMID: 6986251  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Possible role of enzyme induction.\n\nPessayre D, de Saint-Louvent P, Degott C, Bernuau J, Rueff B, Benhamou JP.\n\nThe authors report the cases of 3 patients who died from fulminant hepatitis\nafter receiving iproclozide, a hydrazine-containing monoamine oxidase inhibitor. \nFulminant hepatitis in these patients resembled that reported in patients\nreceiving other hydrazine-containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors: (1) the 3\npatients were women; (2) the monoamine oxidase inhibitor has been ingested for 1 \nmonth or more; (3) the main clinical manifestations were jaundice and disorders\nof consciousness; (4) hypersensitivity manifestations were absent; (5) the\npredominant liver lesion was necrosis; (6) all 3 patients died. In our 3\npatients, jaundice occurred 7 to 10 days after the adjunction to iproclozide of a\nmicrosomal enzyme inducer. These observations suggest that concomitant\nadministration of iproclozide and of microsomal enzyme inducers may produce\nfulminant hepatitis in man. It is speculated that iproclozide could be, like\niproniazid, transformed into a hepatotoxic metabolite, the production of which\nwould be increased by microsomal enzyme induction.\n\nPMID: 680506  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient had no\nprevious history of tuberculosis. Because of persistent inflammation and painful \nswelling of the epididymides and testes, the patient underwent bilateral\norchiectomy. This case demonstrates the late adverse effects that can occur after\nintravesical BCG therapy, which in our patient ended in surgical removal of both \ngonads.\n\nPMID: 15667898  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The dog had been on a \ntreatment regimen that included a salicylate-containing drug, and the owners\nunknowingly supplemented aspirin. Supportive treatment utilizing sodium\nbicarbonate resulted in return to normal within 24 hours.

S'\n1. Ryumachi. 2003 Jun;43(3):569-76.\n\n[Pharmacokinetics of salazosulfapyridine in a hemodialysis patient].\n\n[Article in Japanese]\n\nAkiyama Y(1), Fujimaki T, Sakurai Y.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, Saitama Medical School, Moroyama-machi, Iruma-gun,\nSaitama.\n\nThe patient was a 62-year-old female. Total gastrectomy was performed due to\ngastric ulcer in 1969. She was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 1985 and\nwas developed to amyloidosis in 1991. She was started on hemodialysis (HD) for\nchronic renal failure in 1996. In 1998, her arthralgia was aggravated, and 100\nmg/day of bucillamine was administered on the day of HD. Her arthralgia\npersisted, and switching to salazosulfapyridine (SASP) was considered. As there\nwere no standards and no reports for the use of SASP in HD patients, we examined \nthe pharmacokinetics of SASP and its metabolites, and compared our patient with\nthe results of phase one study in normal subjects in Japan. In this case, the\nblood concentration of SASP was similar to that in healthy controls after single \nadministration of 500 mg of SASP on the day of non-HD, while the concentration of\nsulfapyridine (SP) was higher than that in healthy donors. However, the blood\nconcentrations of SASP, SP, and N4-acetyl-SP (AcSP) at 24 hours after\nadministration were similar to those obtained in healthy men. SASP was not\ndialyzed, while about half of SP and AcSP, were dialyzed. In a five-day\nconsecutive administration study also, the blood concentrations of these\ncompounds on Day 5 were similar to those of phase one study, suggesting no\naccumulation. No adverse drug reaction was observed. As this case had the past\nhistory of total gastrectomy and amyloidosis, it is possible that this result is \ninfluenced by the factors. Therefore it is necessary to examine pharmacokinetics \nof SASP and its metabolites beforehand when administering this agent to other\nHD/RA patients.\n\nPMID: 12910967  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Renal\nbiopsy specimens showed histological changes consistent with drug induced chronic\nintestinal nephritis. Extensive investigation made other causes of chronic renal \nfailure unlikely. One of these patients underwent renal transplantation, the\nother has impaired but stable renal function.\n\nPMCID: PMC1379424\nPMID: 1353741  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We describe a case of\nHSgammadeltaTCL with a leukaemic course in a patient with Crohn's disease who had\nreceived azathioprine during the previous 5.5 years. Sinusoidal infiltration by\natypical lymphocytes was observed in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and the\ntypical cytogenetic abnormalities (isochromosome 7 and trisomy 8) were found. The\npatient did not respond to intensive chemotherapy. This case shows the importance\nof ruling out HSgammadeltaTCL in patients with hepatosplenomegaly, B-symptoms and\nany immunosuppressive condition.\n\nPMID: 12688327  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The leukocyte differentiation revealed 54% medium-size immature\nlymphocytes. The majority of lymphocytes showed the B-cell characteristics of\nIgGk monoclonality, and CD19+ and CD20+ in cell surface phenotype, suggesting a\nB-cell malignancy, non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the leukemic phase. Arthropathy\nassociated with lymphoid malignancy was suspected. However, the infiltrated\nleukocytes in the synovial fluid of the left knee joint were dominantly\nneutrophils and CD3+ T-cells, and compatible with the findings in rheumatoid\narthritis (RA). The association of B-cell malignancy and RA is not frequently\nreported. We discuss the common underlying immunological abnormalities in both\nB-cell malignancy and RA.\n\nPMID: 9144020  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Despite\ncontinued treatment with prednisolone and salazosulfapyridine, as well as\nazathioprine and metronidazole, no lasting remission was obtained. Widespread\nsevere osteoporosis with vertebral fractures made it necessary to discontinue the\nprednisolone, despite endoscopically and biochemically confirmed signs of\nactivity of the disease. Administration of cyclosporin A in this situation\nproduced phases of improved clinical and biochemical parameters. Regular control \nof biochemical levels failed to reveal any drug-specific acute side-effects.\nBecause of the increased incidence of malignant lymphoma under cyclosporin A this\ndrug should be held in reserve in the treatment of Crohn's disease, until results\nfrom controlled studies have become available.\n\nPMID: 2857635  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

An 18-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of\nfever, skin rash, dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. She had been given\nsalazosulfapyridine for two weeks to treat Crohn's disease. A chest radiograph\nand computed tomographic scan showed multiple nodular shadows in both lung\nfields, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and bilateral pleural effusions. Cessation\nof salazosulfapyridine followed by corticosteroid therapy led to an immediate\nsymptomatic improvement. The drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test for\nsalazosulfapyridine was negative. The same symptoms reappeared with rechallenge\nof SASP, however, which led to diagnosis as salazosulfapyridine-induced\npneumonitis. This is apparently the first case report of\nsalazosulfapyridine-induced pneumonitis with a radiographic pattern of multiple\npulmonary nodules; accumulation of similar case reports are needed to confirm the\nassociation.\n\nPMID: 17233389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A routine chest X ray\nshowed a round, well defined opacity in right lung field. A chest CT scan\nconfirmed the finding and also described bronchiectasis. Patient had no\nrespiratory symptoms. He was prescribed with oral sulfasalazine and\ncorticosteroids with rapid improvement of intestinal symptoms as well as\nresolution of the pulmonary opacity. We describe the clinical presentation of a\nmale newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease who was found to have an asymptomatic\npulmonary lesion on imaging studies. Pulmonary complications have been previously\ndescribed in inflamatory bowel disease being more common in ulcerative colitis\nthan in Crohn's disease; these can involve the lung parenchyma, the\ntracheobronchial tree, and the pleura. The true prevalence and etiology of these \nlesions is currently unknown and are not necessarily associated with bowel\ndisease activity. Abnormal pulmonary functions test have been reported during\ninflammatory bowel disease exacerbations, and although pulmonary findings can\npresent with a variety of symptoms, subclinical presentations have also been\ndescribed. Pulmonary manifestations are usually steoid-responsive, as was the\ncase in our patients.\n\nPMID: 14716424  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

It is still a widely used\nanti-inflammatory agent especially in the treatment of rheumatologic disorders\nand inflammatory bowel diseases. Most of its side effects are benign, tolerable, \nand dose dependent, but less common severe systemic reactions have also been\nrevealed.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was\nadmitted to emergency service because of status epilepticus. Hepatitis and\nmyelotoxicity were also present after laboratory investigations. The patient was \non sulfasalazine treatment for 3 weeks with a daily dose of 2g. Cranial magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral periventricular and subcortical\nlesions in the white matter of especially temporal and occipital regions.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed very high protein level (564 mg/L). \nAfter discontinuation of treatment, the clinical, CSF, and MRI findings regressed\nrapidly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Side effects of sulfasalazine include neurotoxicity such as status\nepilepticus, cranial MRI lesions, and CSF abnormalities that were diagnosed in\nour patient after excluding other etiologic factors causing encephalitis.\n\nPMID: 19050416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

She presented with fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy,\nand hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed a marked increase of atypical\nlymphocytes in the peripheral blood and biphasic hepatic dysfunction. IM-like\nsyndrome can be caused by various drugs, including SASP, and the concept of\ndrug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome has been proposed recently. IM-like\nsyndrome due to SASP has been reported in patients taking higher dosages for the \ntreatment of inflammatory bowel disease, but has not been reported earlier in\npatients with RA. The results of the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test\ntests suggested that 5-aminosalicylic acid was a possible causative metabolite.\nThis severe type of drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction mimicking IM due to\nSASP should be granted wider awareness in the field of rheumatology, because the \ndrug is widely used for the treatment of RA.\n\nPMID: 18084702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient met the\nInternational Headache Society's criteria for idiopathic intracranial\nhypertension. Sulphasalazine was discontinued and the patient was given\nazathioprine for ulcerative colitis and acetazolamide for intracranial\nhypertension. Three weeks later, her examination was normal and lumbar puncture\nrevealed an opening pressure of 180-mm H(2)O. Sulphasalazine is a product of 5\naminosalicylate (5 ASA) and there seems to be a relationship between the\nadministration of sulphasalazine and the onset of intracranial hypertension\nsymptoms.

Eight years earlier he had presented a\nsimilar episode which had regressed spontaneously. The neurological examination\nrevealed a tetraparesis with areflexia and hypotonia. These manifestations were\nconcomitant with chronic diarrhea which had been neglected to date. The\nelectrophysiological aspect was compatible with an acute polyradiculoneuritis.\nThe analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed an albumino-cytological\ndissociation. The existence of the diarrhea directed the investigations towards\nan inflammatory enteropathy, which was attested later on by the endoscopic,\nradiologic and histological data leading to the diagnosis of active Crohn's\ndisease. The diagnosis of a relapsing polyradiculoneuritis associated with\nCrohn's disease was retained. The patient was treated by salazopyrine-budesonide \nwith improvement in the digestive and neurological manifestations after 3 years.\nCONCLUSION: The frequency of neurological features in Crohn's disease is not well\ndocumented. The incriminated mechanisms are either directly related to the\ndisease (deficit in B12 vitamin or folic acid and/or by the means of an\nauto-immune vascularitis) or secondary to long-term treatment with metronidazole.\nThe course of neurological manifestations is largely dependent on the course of\nthe inflammatory disease.\n\nPMID: 17351546  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

It usually involves the small intestine and/or the area \naround the anus but can also affect the entire gastrointestinal tract anywhere\nfrom the mouth to the anus. Extra intestinal manifestations occur frequently and \nmultiple organ systems may be affected: the skin, joints, spine, eyes, liver and \nbile ducts. In contrast, nasal manifestations are extremely rare and only a few\ncases have been reported up to date in the worldwide literature. The authors\nreport two cases with nasal manifestations concomitant to intestinal Crohn's\ndisease and go over the relevant literature on such an association.\n\nPMID: 17021783  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

This case report\nillustrates two important points; first, co-occurrence of AS and brucellosis in\nthe same patient, and second, posterior element involvement with abscess\nformation in erector spinae muscle, which has not been previously reported.\nMagnetic resonance imaging is a sensitive method for detecting spinal brucellosis\nand extent of infection throughout paravertebral structures.

Although severe reactions to\nsulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware\nof unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.\n\nPMCID: PMC56591\nPMID: 11570976  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

At day 21 and day 10 respectively, pharyngitis, rash, and fever were\nnoted. During the following days, high-grade fever persisted, while jaundice,\nsevere cytolysis and acute liver failure also occurred. Drug hepatotoxicity was\nsuspected and salazopyrin was withdrawn on day 29 and day 24 respectively.\nDevelopment of hepatic encephalopathy led to urgent liver transplantation in both\ncases.\nCONCLUSION: Salazopyrin is a possible cause of fulminant immunoallergic\nhepatitis. Prompt therapeutic interruption is urgent, but it may not alter the\noutcome and or preclude the need for liver transplantation. We suggest that\nsalazopyrin therapy be avoided in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease whenever\npossible, and that the use of pure amino-salicylates be preferred.\n\nPMID: 10394456  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Severe\naxial arthritis and PSC with underlying clinically inactive ulcerative colitis\nwas diagnosed, and treatment with salazosulfapyridine and ursodeoxycholic acid\ninitiated. This led to freedom from pain within a matter of weeks and an\nappreciable reduction in serum cholestasis parameters.\n\nPMID: 7903077  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hinduja National Hospital & Medical Research\nCenter, V.S Marg, Mahim (w), Mumbai-16, India.\n\nWe studied the clinical profile, laboratory parameters, disease course, and\noutcomes of patients with adult onset Still's disease (AOSD). A retrospective\nanalysis of adult patients with Still's disease diagnosed from 2000 to 2004 was\ncarried out. Their clinical features and laboratory findings at presentation,\ndisease course, and outcomes were analyzed. Data of 14 patients with Still's\ndisease were analyzed. The age at disease onset ranged from 16 to 59 years with a\nmean of 29.85, the male to female ratio being 9:5. The mean duration of illness\nfrom onset of symptoms to presentation was 14.5 months (range). The most common\nclinical manifestations were fever (n = 14), articular symptoms (n = 14), rash (n\n= 8), weight loss (n = 12), and sore throat (n = 5). Elevated ESR was present in \nall patients with a mean of 98.3 mm at 1 h. Hepatic enzymes were elevated in\nseven patients at disease onset. The mean duration of follow up was 19.14 months \n(range). Three patients progressed to chronic arthropathy. Cyclosporine led to\ndramatic recovery in five patients. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was\npresent in two patients, one after sulfasalazine therapy. One patient with MAS\ndied. Still's disease, although uncommon, has characteristic constellation of\nclinical and laboratory features and should be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of fever of unknown origin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nsteroids, and methotrexate may not be always effective, and cyclosporine is an\neffective drug in resistant cases. Sulfasalazine should be avoided in cases of\nAOSD.\n\nPMID: 17701269  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The syndrome\nis defined by the clinical triad of fever, skin rash and internal organ\ninvolvement and can be life-threatening condition. We describe three patients\ntreated in our institution. The first was a 32-year-old man who developed toxic\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) with pulmonary and liver involvement after initiation \nof lamotrigine therapy for concomitant epilepsy. The second 32-year-old man was\ntreated with salazopyrine and omeprazole in order to relief the symptoms of\ninflammatory bowel disease, but as a result developed toxic epidermal necrolysis \nwith elevated liver enzymes. The third patient was a 28-year-old man with long\nhistory of alcohol abuse who began treatment with carbamazepine and a few days\nlater he was admitted to the clinic with symptoms of severe disseminated skin\nrash. The patients had peripheral eosinophilia. All the patients needed urgent\nlife-saving therapy, intensive care and nursing. The culprit drug was\ndiscontinued and prompt systemic therapy with corticosteroids at an initial dose \nof 2 mg/kg/d and with broad spectrum antibiotics was started. Topical therapy\nincluded spraying Av\xc3\xa8ne thermal water and local antiseptics. Resolution and\nepithelization of skin erosions were observed in about 4 weeks after the\ninitiation of the therapy. Medications can give rise to certain adverse reactions\nincluding serious cutaneous and systemic involvement. TEN is a rare complication \nof DHS. Patients who develop DHS need optimal and adequate treatment. The\nconcomitant use of corticosteroids and broad spectrum systemic antibiotics is\nessential. The local therapy plays an important part in relieving symptoms and\nshould consist of mild preparations with minimally sensitizing potential.\n\nPMID: 17673387  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 40-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis\nwas admitted to a local hospital 26 days after initiation of sulphasalazine\ntreatment. She had fever, lymphadenopathy, dermatitis and facial oedema and\nshowed biochemical signs of progressive hepatitis. Peripheral blood counts showed\nelevated leucocyte count with 15% atypical plasmacytes. Lymph node biopsy showed \naltered follicular architecture, a diffuse CD 4 positive predominance and\nhistiocytes with erythrophagocytosis. Investigation by gene rearrangement for\nclonality of B- and T-lymphocytes ruled out the suspicion of lymphoma.\nHaematological and near-fatal hepatological changes resolved following\ndiscontinuation of sulphasalazine and a three-week course of glucocorticoid\ntherapy. Early awareness of this syndrome via measuring liver function tests on, \ne.g., days 14-35 in patients started on sulphasalazine is recommended.\n\nPMID: 17032600  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Two weeks after starting treatment, a high degree, subcontinuous fever\noccurred, together with systemic discomfort, fatigue, headache, and ultimately a \nmoderate wakefulness impairment. Upon admission to the hospital, a malar rash\nbecame evident. Modest notes of hepatotoxicity were also evident. All of the\nsymptoms suddenly resolved after SSZ withdrawal. The markers of hepatitis become \nnegative just 2 months later. It is interesting to note that after dismissal, in \norder to counteract the severe arthritic conditions and the presence of a type 2 \ndiabetes, a combined therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporin had to be used,\nwith no renal or hepatic side effects and remarkable therapeutic effects. No\nmarkers of autoimmunity were found in this patient. The chronology and the\nclinical events here described may confirm the hypothesis of a idiosyncratic\nreaction to SSZ, closely resembling a rare, sometimes irreversible, condition\nknown as "the 3 week sulphasalazine syndrome".\n\nPMID: 14976471  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. J Clin Gastroenterol. 1985 Oct;7(5):400-4.\n\nUlcerative colitis in association with chronic paranoid schizophrenia: a review\nof steroid-induced psychiatric disorders.\n\nAlcena V, Alexopoulos GS.\n\nA 21-year-old schizophrenic man developed ulcerative colitis. Because he might\nhave needed steroids, we reviewed the literature on the use of steroids in\npatients with psychiatric disorders. The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms\nduring steroid therapy is unknown. Development of psychiatric complications in\npatients receiving steroids is probably dose-dependent. The type of psychiatric\nmanifestations is variable, ranging from affective through schizophreniform\nsyndromes. It is unclear whether a history of psychiatric disorders increases the\nrisk for psychiatric problems from steroids. In the majority of patients\npsychiatric complications remit when the dose of steroids is reduced or\ndiscontinued, or when appropriate pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are\nadministered. Preliminary studies suggest that lithium may prevent development of\nsteroid psychosis.\n\nPMID: 2866212  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Box 40047, Jeddah 21499, Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia. amindaoulah@yahoo.com\n\nDrug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome represents one\npattern of the cutaneous involvement in type IV hypersensitivity reaction to\ndrugs. It is a severe, delayed, idiosyncratic reaction presented as rash with\nfever, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. There are several reported\ncases of sulfasalazine-induced DRESS syndrome, but myocardial involvement was\nrare. High index of suspicion is needed in every patient receiving these drugs\nfor prompt diagnosis and early management. We report a case of a 56-year-old\nwoman treated with sulfasalazine for ankylosing spondylitis for 3 weeks, which\nwas discontinued after development of DRESS syndrome. Despite treating her with\nhigh dose of steroid and cyclosporine, her symptoms persisted, and ultimately,\nshe developed toxic myocarditis with a misleading presentation of acute\nST-elevated myocardial infarction. The diagnosis was made based on postmortem\nhistopathologic finding.\n\nPMID: 21514761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We describe two patients with rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) who developed biopsy-proven WG with serious organ involvement\nduring SSZ therapy. The pathogenetic mechanism that explains the relationship\nbetween SSZ and the occurrence of a de novo anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody \n(ANCA)-related vasculitis or a flare is discussed. We propose that WG can be a\nrare complication of SSZ therapy and that this, like other autoimmune adverse\nevents of this drug, is mediated by SSZ-induced apoptosis.\n\nPMID: 18189198  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In this case, discontinuation of the\ntreatment and cautious switch to another 5-ASA compound should be tested.\n\nPMID: 17440739  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Initial treatment with cyclophosphamide and\nsteroids achieved complete remission. Subsequent relapse with marked retinal\nvasculitis at first was refractory to the standard treatment. Renewed remission\nwas obtained with additional infliximab, and was maintained with azathioprine for\n12 months before the patient again presented with symmetrical polyarthritis.\nINVESTIGATIONS: Clinical examination revealed a symmetrical polyarthritis\ninvolving the joints of the hand and fingers. The acute-phase parameters were\nraised, the rheumafactor was highly positive. Radiology showed early erosions in \nthe bones of the hand. There were no indices of renewed activity of the\nChurg-Strauss syndrome.\nTREATMENT AND COURSE: These findings indicated sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis\nand methotrexate was started, later supplemented with sulfsalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine because of continuing signs of activity. Infliximab was again \ngiven because of further progression, but a severe infusion reaction developed\nduring the second infusion. After changing to etanercept remission of the\nrheumatoid arthritis was achieved.\nCONCLUSION: The development of rheumatoid arthritis during remission achieved\nwith azathioprine in Churg-Strauss syndrome of four-year duration is very rare.\nRepeated dosis of infliximab at long intervals greatly increases the risk of an\nintolerance.\n\nPMID: 16118729  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Multiple organs can be\ninvolved. Entero-Beh\xc3\xa7et's disease is often uncontrollable, relapsing, and can\ncause acute intestinal bleeding or perforation. We utilized a combination therapy\nincluding 600 mg of pentoxifylline per day, in two doses, to treat three female\npatients and observed the subsequent changes in clinical symptoms, serum C\nreactive protein levels, and endoscopic findings. In all three patients, clinical\nsymptoms as well as serum C reactive protein levels improved immediately.\nEndoscopically, lower intestinal lesions were significantly reduced or healed in \nall of them. Combination therapy including pentoxifylline appears to be\nclinically effective in the patients with entero-Beh\xc3\xa7et's disease.\n\nPMID: 11806151  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Cervical and inguinal\nlymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis,\nassociated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates,\nwithout viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week\nlater, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of\nanti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and\naccompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died \nsome 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination\nshowed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity\nmyocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow \nnecrosis, with no evidence of malignancy.

Her past medical\nhistory consisted of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis, asthma, and ulcerative\ncolitis. Warfarin concentrations had consistently remained within the therapeutic\nrange with dosages of approximately 30 mg per week. In an attempt to treat\narthritis, her gastroenterologist replaced 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) with\nsulfasalazine 1000 mg four times daily. Subsequent to the medication changes, the\ninternational normalized ratio (INR) decreased and remained at subtherapeutic\nconcentrations despite increases in the warfarin dosage. During this period, the \npatient developed a deep-vein thrombosis in the right popliteal vein. The INR did\nnot return to an acceptable level until six weeks after sulfasalazine was\nstarted. The new warfarin dosage was 75 mg per week, a 250% dosage increase. When\nsulfasalazine was discontinued and 5-ASA reinstituted, the warfarin dosage\nrequirements to achieve therapeutic INRs returned to weekly dosages of\napproximately 45 mg.\nDISCUSSION: Sulfonamides have been well documented to enhance the anticoagulant\neffect of warfarin. This patient developed a new deep-vein thrombosis due to\nfailure in maintaining therapeutic INR levels after the recent introduction of\nsulfasalazine. We suspect that she developed warfarin resistance secondary to\nconcomitant use of sulfasalazine. This patient demonstrated warfarin resistance\nas opposed to enhanced anticoagulant effect with sulfasalazine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians managing warfarin therapy should exercise caution when\nsulfasalazine is added to a patient's medical regimen. This case suggests a\npossible warfarin-sulfasalazine interaction that resulted in warfarin resistance.\n\nPMID: 11098339  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Pericarditis\nas a side effect induced by sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, drugs used in\nthe therapy of these diseases, was first described only 7 years ago. In older\ncase reports the relationship between the use of these drugs and pericarditis is \nunclear. We analyze the reported cases of 68 patients (38 men, 24 women) with\nulcerative colitis (n = 45) or Crohn's disease (n = 15) who had one or more\nepisodes of pericarditis or myopericarditis. Pericarditis was not associated with\nhigh activity of bowel disease in all cases. In most cases therapy with\ncorticosteroids led to uneventful recovery. In drug induced pericarditis omission\nof the 5-ASA therapy was sufficient in a few cases. There was one fatal case\n(with myocarditis). The decision whether pericarditis is a symptom of the\nunderlying disease or a side effect of the drug used for the treatment of the\ndisease is not always easy. We present an analysis (clinical problem solving) of \na pertinent observation in a patient with Crohn's disease and pericarditis,\nshowing the dilemma of pericarditis in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and its\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 9005529  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There are increasing reports, however, of false-positive c-ANCAs, usually\nin the setting of other vasculidities. We report a case of a 27-year-old man with\nulcerative colitis who developed pulmonary symptoms, peripheral nodular lung\ninfiltrates, and an elevated c-ANCA suggesting WG. Chest CT and open lung biopsy \nspecimens were consistent with WG. The symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates\nresolved after discontinuation of sulfasalazine therapy.

Occupations requiring prolonged\nstanding and forceful use of hands may be seriously compromised by this\ncondition. The severe forms of the disease are usually unresponsive to\nantihistamines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and patients frequently \nrequire corticosteroids for control of symptoms.\nOBJECTIVE: It was the purpose of this report to evaluate the clinical utility of \nsulfasalazine for two patients with refractory delayed pressure urticaria.\nMETHODS: Sulfasalazine, starting at 500 mg/day (with weekly incremental dosing to\na total of 4 g), was administered to two patients with disabling pressure\nurticaria and angioedema (symptomatic daily with normal activities) who had\nfailed all other reported therapeutic options except corticosteroids.\nRESULTS: Patient A required daily prednisone in excess of 30 mg (for more than 6 \nmonths) to control his painful angioedema sufficiently in order to continue\nworking as a colorectal surgeon. Patient B also experienced daily symptoms for\nmore than 1 year. Both patients tolerated sulfasalazine to a dose of 4 g/day\nwithout adverse reactions and achieved complete resolution of symptoms. Patient A\ncontinued to be well controlled 1 year after starting but must maintain a dose of\n2 g or greater per day. Patient B reported excellent control 6 months after\nstarting but was subsequently lost to follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine, in doses used for inflammatory bowel disease, appears \nto be an effective alternative therapy for delayed pressure urticaria and\nangioedema in patients poorly controlled by traditional treatment and may act as \na corticosteroid-sparing agent.\n\nPMID: 7697475  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the two men the protein C\ndeficiency was diagnosed only after the onset of severe thromboembolic\ncomplications (cavernous sinus thrombosis; pulmonary embolism) during heparin\ntreatment. But in the woman protein C activity was measured immediately after\nhospital admission (in the knowledge of the first two cases) even before heparin \nadministration was started. All three patients received treatment with\nsulphasalazine (3 g daily) and fluocortolone (60 mg daily), as well as full\nheparinization (22,500-36,000 IU daily). Protein C activity returned to normal on\nremission of the ulcerative colitis (in one case only after subtotal colectomy). \nThese case reports show that acquired protein C deficiency can be reversed by\nrigorous treatment of the underlying disease.\n\nPMID: 1347501  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The association between cutaneous\npolyarteritis nodosa and Crohn's disease is discussed and the treatment of\nearlier reported cases is reviewed.\n\nPMID: 1970606  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Here, we report two sisters with a fatal course of PNP deficiency due\nto delay in diagnosis. The first patient developed a liver abscess by Aspergillus\nfumigatus and the second patient developed Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\nlymphadenitis and probable pulmonary tuberculosis due to disseminated BCG\ninfection. The patients also suffered from sclerosing cholangitis. Mutation\nanalysis of the PNP gene from both sisters revealed a homozygous mutation for a\nG>A at nucleotide 349 (349 G>A transition), which changes alanine 117 to\ntheronine in exon 4 (A117T). An increased awareness of early signs, symptoms, and\nabnormal laboratory findings of PNP deficiency will establish the early prognosis\nand treatment.\n\nPMID: 19657670  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two\nphenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations\nwithin the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT\ninterval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial\nfeatures, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of\nTS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have\ncortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted\nmutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS\nassociated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene\nmutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand\nboth the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nPMCID: PMC3319791\nPMID: 22106044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fitzgerald@dcpah.msu.edu\n\nBovine leukosis associated with infection with the delta retrovirus Bovine\nleukemia virus (BLV) is endemic in many cattle herds in the United States.\nInfection has been associated with immunosuppression and decreased productivity. \nCases of tuberculosis in cows due to infection with Mycobacterium bovis reemerged\nin Michigan in 1998, and despite intensive eradication attempts, new cases of\nbovine tuberculosis are sporadically identified. The present report details a\ncoinfection with BLV and M. bovis in a Holstein cow from Michigan that presented \nas part of a bovine tuberculosis screening program. Peripheral and visceral lymph\nnodes of this animal were markedly enlarged, homogeneously pale white, and bulged\non the cut surface. The submandibular, mesenteric, and caudal mediastinal lymph\nnodes contained multifocal to coalescing caseogranulomas that ranged from 1 to 5 \ncm in diameter. Histologically, dense sheets of monomorphic populations of\nneoplastic lymphocytes obliterated the normal architecture of all lymph nodes.\nCaseogranulomas were characterized by central pools of amorphous degenerate\neosinophilic and occasionally mineralized granular debris surrounded by thick\nrims of epithelioid macrophages, occasional Langhan's type giant cells, and\nfibrosis. Polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for BLV. Cultures of\naffected lymph nodes yielded growth of M. bovis.\n\nPMID: 19901295  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We report 3 similar BCG infections in children and describe\nevidence of respiratory transmission to health care workers (HCWs) from 1\npatient. These children were receiving chemotherapy for leukemia when they\npresented with active tuberculosis. Each isolate was identified biochemically and\nby both gas-liquid chromatography and major polymorphic tandem repeat-polymerase \nchain reaction. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that 2 isolates were\nidentical strains and identical to the Tice and Connaught strains licensed in the\nUnited States for bladder chemotherapy. The third isolate differed by a single\nfragment after DraI restriction. One patient with heavily positive sputum exposed\nnumerous HCWs. Of 41 HCWs, 2 (5%) converted their purified protein derivatives\n(PPD) skin test. These data underscore the risk of nosocomial BCG transmission by\ncontamination of chemotherapy solutions and demonstrate the potential for\ntransmission to HCWs from patients with active pulmonary disease.\n\nPMID: 10671341  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

When such infection occurs, it is usually in patients with\ndecreased cellular immunity. A 6-year-old Caucasian girl who was receiving\nmaintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with symptoms\nof meningitis. A temporal-lobe biopsy revealed acid-fast bacilli that were\nidentified as Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Neither the patient nor any family members\nhad been immunized previously.

Epub 2011 \nJul 14.\n\nDisseminated BCG infection mimicking metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in an\nimmunodeficient child with a novel hypomorphic NEMO mutation.\n\nImamura M(1), Kawai T, Okada S, Izawa K, Takachi T, Iwabuchi H, Yoshida S,\nHosokai R, Kanegane H, Yamamoto T, Umezu H, Nishikomori R, Heike T, Uchiyama M,\nImai C.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Pediatrics, Department of Homeostatic Regulation and Development,\nNiigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757\nAsahimachi-Dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.\n\nBACKGROUND: Nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency is a\ndevelopmental and immunological disorder. The genetic and phenotypic correlation \nhas been described.\nMETHODS: We report a unique clinical presentation and the identification of a\nnovel missense mutation in the NEMO gene in a 3-year-old boy with bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin (BCG) infection.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and abnormal\nanti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers, suggestive of EBV-related diseases\nincluding chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, or\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although the biopsy specimen from a nasopharyngeal\nlesion was initially diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, this was changed to\ndisseminated BCG infection involving the nasopharynx, multiple systemic lymph\nnodes, and brain. A novel mutation (designated D311E) in the NEMO gene, located\nin the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain, was identified as the underlying\ncause of the immunodeficiency. Impaired immune responses which are characteristic\nof patients with NEMO deficiency were demonstrated. The patient underwent\nsuccessful unrelated bone marrow transplantation at 4.9\xc2\xa0years of age.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of the NUB domain in host defense \nagainst mycobacteria. The unique presenting features in our patient indicate that\na hypomorphic NEMO mutation can be associated with atypical pathological findings\nof the epithelial tissues in patients with BCG infection.\n\nPMID: 21755389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Arch Intern Med. 1991 Mar;151(3):591-3.\n\nRefractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical salicylate intoxication.\n\nRaschke R(1), Arnold-Capell PA, Richeson R, Curry SC.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, Phoenix,\nAriz. 85006.\n\nWe describe a case of severe refractory hypoglycemia secondary to topical\nsalicylate intoxication. A 72-year-old man with psoriasis and end-stage renal\ndisease was treated with a topical cream containing 10% salicylic acid. The\npatient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia\nrefractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate\nconcentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied\nby rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory \nhypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin.\nSalicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization,\nresulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on\nhypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate.\n\nPMID: 2001141  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Dermatology. 1999;198(4):388-90.\n\nPhotosensitivity with sulfasalazopyridine hypersensitivity syndrome.\n\nBouyssou-Gauthier ML(1), B\xc3\xa9dane C, Boulinguez S, Bonnetblanc JM.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier R\xc3\xa9gional et Universitaire\nDupuytren, Limoges, France.\n\nFive weeks after the start of treatment with an association of\nsulfasalazopyridine and piroxicam, a 30-year-old woman presented with an\neczematous eruption in light-exposed areas, hepatomegaly and fever (38 degrees\nC). Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis, eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis.\nTreatment consisted of withdrawing the two drugs and topical steroids. The\nclinical signs regressed in 6 days. An increase in eosinophilia and hepatic\ncytolysis was observed until the tenth day, after which the trend reversed.\nLaboratory parameters were normal on the twentieth day. One month later,\nphotopatch testing was performed. A patch test with sulfanilamide irradiated with\nUVA was positive. Clinical and laboratory findings were highly suggestive of drug\nhypersensitivity syndrome. The positive result from the UVA photopatch test with \nsulfanilamide suggests that sulfasalazopyridine was involved in the occurrence of\nhypersensitivity syndrome in our patient. We conclude that photodistributed\neruptions can be observed in drug hypersensitivity syndrome with photosensitizing\ndrugs.\n\nPMID: 10449939  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

He presented with a 3-week\nhistory of pain and swelling in his left knee, gradually increasing in severity\nwith an inability to bear weight. He was systemically well with normal vital\nsigns. Examination confirmed an effusion and aspiration was turbid in appearance.\nC reactive protein (CRP) was normal. He was treated empirically with antibiotics.\nSynovial fluid and blood cultures confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection. He\ncompleted a 6 weeks course of antibiotics with complete resolution of symptoms.\nThroughout the treatment his CRP remained normal which is likely to have been the\nresult of prior treatment with tocilizumab.\n\nPMID: 24177456  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

However, TNF-\xce\xb1\ninhibition may lead to adverse events, including liver injury. The RA patients\nare frequently treated with several potentially hepatotoxic drugs concomitantly; \nhence, a causative link between TNF-\xce\xb1 inhibitors and liver injury is usually\ndifficult to establish. We report two cases of RA patients who developed\nhistologically manifest liver injury shortly after the introduction of treatment \nwith two different TNF-\xce\xb1 inhibitors. Furthermore, we present the analysis of the \nlaboratory data from the BioRx.si registry (the Slovenian national registry of\nrheumatologic patients treated with biologicals) and provide evidence that\nelevated levels of serum aminotransferase can be observed in patients treated\nwith TNF-\xce\xb1 inhibitors. Additionally, our analysis suggests no significant\ndifferences between the impact of adalimumab and etanercept on aminotransferase\nlevels. Although the use of TNF-alpha inhibitors is safe and efficient, we\nsuggest that continuous careful monitoring of aminotransferase levels in patients\ntreated with these agents is probably warranted.\n\nPMID: 22955878  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Suspicion of this disorder obliges rapid withdrawal of the suspected\ndrug, which may have been introduced up to 3 months earlier. Screening for human \nherpesvirus (HHV) 6 reactivation is important both for its diagnostic value and\nfor its association with a poor prognosis. Reactivation of this virus is not a\ncontraindication for systemic corticosteroid treatment, which should be tapered\nslowly in order to avoid recurrence. The possible appearance of antiphospholipid \nantibodies must also be considered in those cases associated with\nthrombocytopenia, altered hemostasis, or thrombotic events. Autoimmune disorders \nmay also develop as a sequela of the condition. Medium-to-long-term follow-up is \nrequired even after complete resolution of the condition. We describe a new case \nof sulfasalazine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome associated with HHV-6\nreactivation and the induction of anticardiolipin and anti-thyroid peroxidase\nantibodies.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 Elsevier Espa\xc3\xb1a, S.L. y AEDV.

The type and duration of therapy varies considerably\namong reports and no single antibiotic is considered the treatment of choice. A\n61-year-old patient, suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (treated with\nmetotrexate and salazopyrine), presented with violaceous nodules of the right leg\nthat had been evolving for 6 months. She was underwent several skin biopsies.\nTissue culture of the last showed an atypical mycobacteria, identified as M.\nchelonae. Despite improvement after a two-week course of treatment with\nclarithromycin, a switch to ciprofloxacin was made because of gastrointestinal\nintolerance. After 3 months, only slight improvement of the lesions was achieved \nand clarithromycin was reintroduced; significant clinical improvement occurred by\nthe third month. Clarithromycin was continued a further two months until the\npatient quit on her own and. no recurrence was observed. Infections caused by M. \nchelonae frequently occur in the setting of immunological impairment.\nContaminated water is the natural reservoir, but we were unable to establish the \nsource of contamination. As was previously described, there was a significant\ndelay between clinical presentation and diagnosis. Thus, a high index of\nsuspicion and multiple biopsies with culture are of paramount importance to\nconfirming the diagnosis.\n\nPMID: 20409410  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Wiegering_V@kinderklinik.uni-wuerzburg.de\n\nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) has broad effects on the immune system\nincluding lymphoid organ development as well as growth, survival und function of \nimmune cells. TNFalpha has two main functions: regulatory effects and\nproinflammatory activities. In several diseases such as juvenile and adult\n"rheumatoid" arthritis, psoriasis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, the\napplication of TNFalpha-blocking medications has been beneficial. However,\ninduction of inflammation in several organs including the eye, CNS, skin and\ngastrointestinal tract has been reported. We report on an 11-year-old girl with\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, who developed Crohn\'s disease (CD) while taking\netanercept for her arthritis. Etanercept was discontinued and an antibody-based\nanti-TNF treatment using adalimumab was started, which induced remission of the\ngastrointestinal symptoms promptly. This case indicates that immunodysregulatory \nand even proinflammatory effects of etanercept are of relevance in the clinical\npractice. Furthermore, TNFalpha as a part of its function seems to downregulate\nmucosal inflammation in CD.\n\nPMID: 19506877  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

He\nwas treated with 1 g salazosulfapyridine (SASP) daily for two years.\nHematological investigations conducted since 2005 demonstrated hemoglobin\nconcentrations of 8 approximately 9 g/dl, which then dropped to 4.9 g/dl on\nNovember 21, 2007, following which he was admitted to our hospital. Megaloblastic\nanemia associated with SASP treatment and anemia of chronic disorders were\ndiagnosed on the basis of folate deficiency and bone marrow examination. This\nreport describes a case of megaloblastic anemia, which developed two years after \nstarting SASP and promptly recovered after its withdrawal and treatment with\nfolic acid and prednisolone. The doses of SASP prescribed for RA in Japan are\nless than those prescribed abroad. Megaloblastic anemia associated with SASP\ntreatment for RA is not usually detected in Japan. Currently, SASP is widely used\nand one of the key drugs in the treatment of RA.

She presented with fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy,\nand hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed a marked increase of atypical\nlymphocytes in the peripheral blood and biphasic hepatic dysfunction. IM-like\nsyndrome can be caused by various drugs, including SASP, and the concept of\ndrug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome has been proposed recently. IM-like\nsyndrome due to SASP has been reported in patients taking higher dosages for the \ntreatment of inflammatory bowel disease, but has not been reported earlier in\npatients with RA. The results of the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test\ntests suggested that 5-aminosalicylic acid was a possible causative metabolite.\nThis severe type of drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction mimicking IM due to\nSASP should be granted wider awareness in the field of rheumatology, because the \ndrug is widely used for the treatment of RA.\n\nPMID: 18084702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Their clinical features and laboratory findings at presentation,\ndisease course, and outcomes were analyzed. Data of 14 patients with Still's\ndisease were analyzed. The age at disease onset ranged from 16 to 59 years with a\nmean of 29.85, the male to female ratio being 9:5. The mean duration of illness\nfrom onset of symptoms to presentation was 14.5 months (range).

Elevated ESR was present in \nall patients with a mean of 98.3 mm at 1 h. Hepatic enzymes were elevated in\nseven patients at disease onset. The mean duration of follow up was 19.14 months \n(range). Three patients progressed to chronic arthropathy. Cyclosporine led to\ndramatic recovery in five patients. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was\npresent in two patients, one after sulfasalazine therapy. One patient with MAS\ndied. Still's disease, although uncommon, has characteristic constellation of\nclinical and laboratory features and should be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of fever of unknown origin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nsteroids, and methotrexate may not be always effective, and cyclosporine is an\neffective drug in resistant cases.

Eight years earlier he had presented a\nsimilar episode which had regressed spontaneously. The neurological examination\nrevealed a tetraparesis with areflexia and hypotonia. These manifestations were\nconcomitant with chronic diarrhea which had been neglected to date. The\nelectrophysiological aspect was compatible with an acute polyradiculoneuritis.\nThe analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed an albumino-cytological\ndissociation. The existence of the diarrhea directed the investigations towards\nan inflammatory enteropathy, which was attested later on by the endoscopic,\nradiologic and histological data leading to the diagnosis of active Crohn's\ndisease. The diagnosis of a relapsing polyradiculoneuritis associated with\nCrohn's disease was retained. The patient was treated by salazopyrine-budesonide \nwith improvement in the digestive and neurological manifestations after 3 years.\nCONCLUSION: The frequency of neurological features in Crohn's disease is not well\ndocumented. The incriminated mechanisms are either directly related to the\ndisease (deficit in B12 vitamin or folic acid and/or by the means of an\nauto-immune vascularitis) or secondary to long-term treatment with metronidazole.\nThe course of neurological manifestations is largely dependent on the course of\nthe inflammatory disease.\n\nPMID: 17351546  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The \nassociation of these two autoimmune diseases might be explained by\netiopathogenetic factors that they have in common. Recently there have been two\npatients observed (48 and 31-year old) in whom two and three years (respectively)\nafter diagnosing ulcerative colitis, symptoms of chronic nephropathy showed up\n(i.e. chronic glomerulonephritis and mild renal failure, respectively). Both of\nthem fulfilled the ACR criteria for SLE. Clinical features and results of\nlaboratory tests allowed the authors to recognize SLE with renal involvement\n(lupus nephritis in one and nephropathy in the course of secondary\nantyphospholipid syndrome in the other patient). In both cases drug-induced lupus\nlike syndrome was taken into consideration in differential diagnosis (as both of \nthe patients were previously treated with sulphasalazine) but clinical features\nand long lasting follow-up after sulphasalazine withdrawal allowed the authors to\nrecognize association of SLE with concomitant nephropathy and UC. In the\npresented article the problems of differential diagnosis of drug-induced\nlupus-like syndromes from SLE coexisting with UC are discussed.\n\nPMID: 17263228  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Her disease\nactivity was not influenced by a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)\nregimen that included bucillamine, D-penicillamine, gold, sulfasalazine, and\nmethotrexate. Due to an increased disease activity, her DMARD treatment regimen\nwas changed to leflunomide. She had also undergone corticosteroid therapy with\nprednisolone ranging from 10 to 15 mg daily over the previous 8 years. She first \npresented with a wound infection at the surgical site of resection arthroplasty\non her left foot, which had caused hematogenous dissemination that led to pelvic \nabscess and sepsis. For the next 2 years, she experienced multiple insufficiency \nfractures in parts of the ilium, sacral body, sacral ala, three thoraco-lumbar\nvertebral bodies (T12, L1, and L2), and subcapital femoral neck without low\nenergy trauma. Postmenopausal osteoporosis, pelvic abscess, sepsis, decreasing\ndaily activity, high RA disease activity, and high-load corticosteroid therapy\nwere considered to be the causes of these fractures. Nonspecific symptoms such as\nlow back pain and fever delayed diagnosis, which may have led to secondary\nfractures. Although her course after treatment was satisfactory during the study \nperiod, we recommend taking repetitive radiographs to detect insufficiency\nfracture for RA patients with continuing pain and reducing the corticosteroid\ndose to prevent infection and fracture.\n\nPMID: 17235652  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

This study analyses their response to\ntreatment, duration of therapy, reasons for stopping, adverse effects, and the\ninfluence of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) phenotype.\nRESULTS: We observed 10 complete and 3 partial responses, and 4 patients\nmaintained complete response for at least 7 years. Eight patients experienced\nadverse effects, and 2 needed to stop treatment (because of photosensitization\nand development of antinuclear antibodies). All side effects occurred in the\nfirst 3 months of treatment. None of the 18 patients developed systemic lupus\nerythematosus. Of the 10 complete responders, 9 were rapid acetylators (RA),\nwhile 4 of the 5 who failed to respond were slow acetylators (SA). Leukopenia and\nphotosensitization were observed in SA patients, while different side effects\noccurred in RA patients (headaches, diarrhea, moderate increase in liver enzymes \nand antinuclear antibodies).\nCONCLUSION: These findings confirm our earlier reports and demonstrate that\nsulfasalazine can be used successfully to treat severe CLE. NAT2 genotyping\nbefore initiating treatment helps to identify potential responders and avoid side\neffects. In RA patients, sulfasalazine can be an alternative to thalidomide after\nantimalarial drugs, whereas in SA patients, it should remain a third-line\ntreatment, to be used only after antimalarials and thalidomide.\n\nPMID: 16840889  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient had typical symptoms of UC, and \ncolonoscopy showed pancolitis. During treatment with sulfasalazopyridine (SASP)\nand steroids, thrombocytopenia was observed. Despite the cessation of drugs,\nsevere thrombocytopenia was noted. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was\nsuspected based on a normal bone marrow megakaryocyte count, positive\nautoantibody to platelet membrane antigen, and the absence of splenomegaly.\nMedical treatment, including increased dosage of steroids, failed to control UC\nand acute thrombocytopenia in this patient. Moreover, acute severe pancreatitis\ndeveloped and abdominal computed tomography showed toxic megacolon. Platelet\ncount recovered after urgent total colectomy without splenectomy. When patients\nwith UC develop thrombocytopenia, particularly in the presence of extensive and\nsignificant colonic inflammation, a diagnosis of ITP should be considered. In\nsuch patients, preexisting UC might be involved in the immunological causal\nmechanism of ITP. In this situation, colectomy might cure both UC and resistant\nthrombocytopenia. Steroid-refractory and life-threatening UC complicated by\nthrombocytopenia presumably caused by ITP is therefore a possible indication for \ncolectomy.\n\nPMID: 16484745  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Initial treatment with cyclophosphamide and\nsteroids achieved complete remission. Subsequent relapse with marked retinal\nvasculitis at first was refractory to the standard treatment. Renewed remission\nwas obtained with additional infliximab, and was maintained with azathioprine for\n12 months before the patient again presented with symmetrical polyarthritis.\nINVESTIGATIONS: Clinical examination revealed a symmetrical polyarthritis\ninvolving the joints of the hand and fingers. The acute-phase parameters were\nraised, the rheumafactor was highly positive. Radiology showed early erosions in \nthe bones of the hand. There were no indices of renewed activity of the\nChurg-Strauss syndrome.\nTREATMENT AND COURSE: These findings indicated sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis\nand methotrexate was started, later supplemented with sulfsalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine because of continuing signs of activity. Infliximab was again \ngiven because of further progression, but a severe infusion reaction developed\nduring the second infusion. After changing to etanercept remission of the\nrheumatoid arthritis was achieved.\nCONCLUSION: The development of rheumatoid arthritis during remission achieved\nwith azathioprine in Churg-Strauss syndrome of four-year duration is very rare.\nRepeated dosis of infliximab at long intervals greatly increases the risk of an\nintolerance.\n\nPMID: 16118729  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We report a case in \na 63-year-old woman who had been on sulfasalazine for 2 months to treat\nrheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted a few days after onset of a flu-like\nsyndrome with a pruriginous maculopapular erythema initially involving the face, \ntrunk, and proximal limbs; a fever of 41 degrees C; and enlargement of the liver,\nspleen, and several peripheral lymph nodes. Blood tests showed marked\neosinophilia (9300/mm3), lymphocytosis, hyperbasophilic cells, and severe\ninflammation. DRESS syndrome was diagnosed. An indirect immunofluorescence assay \nfor human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) was positive, supporting recent HHV6 infection.\nPrimary HHV6 infection and HHV6 reactivation have been incriminated in the\ngenesis of DRESS syndrome. DRESS syndrome continues to carry a high mortality\nrate of about 10%. Drugs previously reported to cause DRESS syndrome include\nsulfasalazine, hydantoin, d-penicillamine, allopurinol, hydrochlorothiazide, and \ncyclosporine. A high index of suspicion for DRESS syndrome should be maintained\nin patients receiving these drugs. Serological tests for HHV6 should be performed\nroutinely in patients with suspected DRESS syndrome, although uncertainty\npersists about the link between HHV6 infection and DRESS syndrome.\n\nPMID: 15681256  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Reports on\nrheumatologic manifestations in patients with HES are very rare. In the case we\nreport a typical rheumatoid arthritis developed in a 58-year-old woman with HES\ntreated with glucocorticoids. Because of the marked glucocorticoids side effects \nshown by the patient (cushingoid habitus, hyperglycemia), we stopped this\ntreatment and replaced it at first by methotrexate and later by cyclosporin, both\nof them associated with sulfasalazine. These drugs revealed very efficacious both\non articular pathology and on the clinical and laboratory manifestations of HES. \nThese data suggest that common pathogenetic mechanisms are likely acting in\nrheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nPMID: 14513118  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Total gastrectomy was performed due to\ngastric ulcer in 1969. She was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 1985 and\nwas developed to amyloidosis in 1991. She was started on hemodialysis (HD) for\nchronic renal failure in 1996. In 1998, her arthralgia was aggravated, and 100\nmg/day of bucillamine was administered on the day of HD. Her arthralgia\npersisted, and switching to salazosulfapyridine (SASP) was considered. As there\nwere no standards and no reports for the use of SASP in HD patients, we examined \nthe pharmacokinetics of SASP and its metabolites, and compared our patient with\nthe results of phase one study in normal subjects in Japan. In this case, the\nblood concentration of SASP was similar to that in healthy controls after single \nadministration of 500 mg of SASP on the day of non-HD, while the concentration of\nsulfapyridine (SP) was higher than that in healthy donors. However, the blood\nconcentrations of SASP, SP, and N4-acetyl-SP (AcSP) at 24 hours after\nadministration were similar to those obtained in healthy men. SASP was not\ndialyzed, while about half of SP and AcSP, were dialyzed. In a five-day\nconsecutive administration study also, the blood concentrations of these\ncompounds on Day 5 were similar to those of phase one study, suggesting no\naccumulation. No adverse drug reaction was observed. As this case had the past\nhistory of total gastrectomy and amyloidosis, it is possible that this result is \ninfluenced by the factors. Therefore it is necessary to examine pharmacokinetics \nof SASP and its metabolites beforehand when administering this agent to other\nHD/RA patients.\n\nPMID: 12910967  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After a 4-year course of sulfasalazine treatment, \nshe presented with skin facial lesions in vespertilio, fever, arthralgias and\nhigh titers of anti-ANA and LE cells. A sulfasalazine-induced lupus syndrome was \ndiagnosed, because after sulfasalazine withdrawal and a short course of\nprednisone, the clinical symptoms disappeared and the laboratory tests returned\nto normal. Mesalazine 3 g/day was started and the patient remained well for the\nnext 3 years, when she was again admitted with fever, weakness, arthralgias,\ndiplopy, strabismus and hypoaesthesia in both hands and feet, microhematuria,\nhaematic casts, hypocomplementemia and high titers of autoimmune antibodies. A\ndiagnosis of associated systemic lupus erythematosus was made. Although a\npulsotherapy with methylprednisolone was started, no improvement was noticed. A\ncyclophosphamide trial was tried and again no positive results occurred. The\npatient evolved to severe clinical manifestations of general vasculitis affecting\nthe central and peripheral nervous system and lungs, having a fatal evolution\nafter 2 weeks. Although uncommon, the association of both disease may occur, and \nthe authors call attention to this possibility, making a brief review of\nliterature.\n\nPMID: 11469224  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

However, MTX therapy alone\nrarely results in remission and frequently does not even produce 50% improvement.\nTherefore, over the course of their disease, many patients will require\nadditional therapy to manage their clinical symptoms. A number of treatment\noptions have proven effective for such patients, most of which entail the\ncontinuation of MTX therapy and the addition of other DMARD. Although the\ncombination of MTX and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the one most commonly used in \nthe US, many clinicians (particularly in Europe) prefer the combination of MTX\nand sulfasalazine. In addition, excellent data now exist for the triple\ncombination of MTX, HCQ, and sulfasalazine in patients who have had a suboptimal \nresponse to MTX, as well as in those with early or well established disease.\nOther combinations, including MTX + cyclosporine or leflunomide, have also been\nhelpful in some patients. Most recently, the tumor necrosis factor blockers,\netanercept and infliximab, have successfully been used to treat a number of\npatients resistant to MTX. The combination of MTX with DMARD or biological agents\nwith different mechanisms of action greatly expands the treatment options for\npatients with RA.\n\nPMID: 11409154  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 26-year-old man was referred to our department, complaining of general\nfatigue, appetite loss, and palpitation. At age 14, blood was discovered in his\nstool and a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made. Since then, he has been\ntreated with salazosulfapyridine and prednisolone. On examination, mild\nexophthalmos and thyroid swelling were observed. Both serum free T3 and T4 levels\nwere increased along with a positive TSH receptor antibody, while TSH was\ndecreased. Scintigraphic and ultrasonographic examinations of the thyroid gland\nshowed diffuse enlargement. Treatment with thiamazole relieved the symptoms and\nnormalized the thyroid function. Although a high incidence of autoimmune thyroid \ndiseases in association with ulcerative colitis has been suggested, only 6 cases \nof hyperthyroidism coexisting with ulcerative colitis have been reported in\nJapan. A common immunological process has been suggested to be implicated in the \npathogenesis of this association, however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.\n\nPMID: 11201369  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

He was admitted to the municiple \nAkiru Hospital in October 1986 by fever, aphtous oral ulcerations, sore throat\nand polyarthralgia. Hematologic examination showed leukocytopenia,\nlymphocytopenia, positive tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody and\nLE cell phenomenon. He has had episodes of convulsion and conciousness loss of\nunknown etiology when he was 17 years old. The diagnosis of SLE was made, and\noral medication of prednisolone was started. Several weeks later, most of\nsymptoms and autoantibodies disappeared, although the oral aphtous ulcerations\nand leukocytopenia remained. In May 1987, he admitted to the other hospital\nbecause of bloody vomiting. Endoscopic examination showed the esophagial\nulceration, and histology of biopsied-specimen was nonspecific esophagitis. The\ncombination of prednisolone and oral cyclophosphamide or methotrexate was\nemployed thereafter. However, the leukocytopenia, oral aphtous ulceration and\nesophagial ulceration continued in spite of these treatments. All the\nimmunosuppressive treatment was stopped at March 1992. In October 1995, he\nadmitted to our hospital because of body weight loss and continuous diarrhea with\noccasional bloody stool. Barium enema and endoscopic examination of the colon\nrevealed the findings compatible with CD. The patient responded favorably to\nmethylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral sulphasalazine. This case\nindicated that cases with inflammatory bowel diseases like CD could show similar \nclinical signs and symptoms to SLE, and in some cases of CD might satisfied the\nclassification of criteria for SLE.\n\nPMID: 11126669  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Although the physiological mechanism of diarrhea is not\nclear, patients do not usually present hydroelectrolytic alterations and the\nresults of routine laboratory investigations are usually normal. The association \nbetween lymphocytic colitis and thyroid disease, possibly autoimmune, in the form\nof hypo- or hyperthyroidism is relatively common. We report a 61-year-old woman\nwith a history of multinodular toxic goiter, whose previously uninvestigated\nchronic diarrhea became more acute and led to the diagnosis of lymphocytic\ncolitis. Results of laboratory investigations revealed only a significant\nhypokalemia with an associated nonfunctioning bilateral adrenal incidentaloma.\nThe patient evolved well when treated with sulfasalazine. Hypokalemia as a\ncomplication of lymphocytic colitis and an association between lymphocytic\ncolitis and toxic multinodular goiter does not seem to have been previously\ndescribed.\n\nPMID: 10726387  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Oral\nsulphasalazine, 2.5 grams daily was successfully used as an alternative treatment\n(3 month follow-up). Two patients, aged 71 and 84 year old, were treated with\ndapsone for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. Both patients stopped their treatment \nbecause of drug induced hemolytic anemia. They then received oral sulphasalazine,\n4 grams daily. The disease was successfully controlled. In the first patient,\nsulphasalazine was discontinued after 13 months; and in the second patient no\nrelapse was seen after a 16 month follow-up period. No adverse side effect of\nsulphasalazine occurred.\nCONCLUSION: Sulphasalazine, that has already been proven to be effective for\nCrohn's disease, also can be used in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. However,\nfurther studies including a larger series of patients along with a longer\nfollow-up are necessary to confirm the efficacy of sulphasalazine in this\ndisease.\n\nPMID: 10365328  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

She was referred to us for persistent edema on her\nface and legs in November 1996. On admission, her 24-hour urinary protein\nexcretion was 4.4 g/day, total serum protein level was 5.3 g/dl, and serum level \nof amyloid A protein (SAA) was elevated to 45.8 mg/ml. A percutaneous renal\nbiopsy was performed, and light microscopy revealed varying degrees of amyloid\ndeposits in the mesangial areas and arteriolar walls. The diagnosis of secondary \namyloidosis (AA amyloidosis) was based on immunohistochemical staining for\namyloid A protein using monoclonal antibody against SAA. Four weeks after\ntreatment with salazosulfapyridine (SASP) and dipyridamole, proteinuria began to \ndecrease and the edema had disappeared. Finally she recovered from nephrotic\nsyndrome. AA amyloidosis has been thought to have a poor prognosis, with\nprogression to renal failure. Since there is no specific effective therapy for\nthe disease, it is very important to reduce the activity of the underlying cause.\nIn our patient with renal amyloidosis following RA, SASP was evidently effective \nfor arthritis and improvement of renal function. SASP might have a beneficial\neffect on AA amyloidosis by suppressing inflammatory cytokines.\n\nPMID: 9805922  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Its etiologies\nare most commonly viral or bacterial infections, lymphoproliferative syndromes,\nacquired or congenital immunodeficiencies, systemic diseases, or immunomodulatory\ntreatment. We describe a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with\nmethotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, and low dose corticosteroids, whose case was\nseriously complicated by the occurrence of acute febrile pancytopenia. The\npancytopenia appeared secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome triggered by\nEscherichia coli septicemia. The evolution was marked by severe aggravation of\nRA, probably due to release of cytokines from macrophages (tumor necrosis\nfactor-alpha, interleukin 6). Reintroduction of MTX (without sulfasalazine)\nresulted in partial remission and there was no reappearance of new hematological \nanomalies after 16 month followup. A knowledge of this syndrome is particularly\nimportant, since it mimics drug toxicity and other complications such as\nlymphoproliferative diseases.\n\nPMID: 9632090  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Anti-nuclear antibody (speckled) and antibodies to\nsingle-stranded DNA and SS-A were positive, while those against native DNA and\nhiston were negative. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse proliferative lupus\nnephritis. His nephrotic syndrome partially improved with corticosteroid therapy \ncombined with cessation of sulfasalazine. His complement level became normal,\nhowever it decreased again during the gradual reduction of corticosteroid dosage.\nIn conclusion, we diagnosed the patient's illness as an idiopathic syntemic lupus\nerythematosus rather than sulfasalazine-induced lupus.\n\nPMID: 8911083  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There are increasing reports, however, of false-positive c-ANCAs, usually\nin the setting of other vasculidities. We report a case of a 27-year-old man with\nulcerative colitis who developed pulmonary symptoms, peripheral nodular lung\ninfiltrates, and an elevated c-ANCA suggesting WG. Chest CT and open lung biopsy \nspecimens were consistent with WG. The symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates\nresolved after discontinuation of sulfasalazine therapy. The c-ANCA remained\nelevated due to the occurrence of false-positive values in ulcerative colitis.

Factors that affect the life span of erythrocytes will also\ninfluence HbA1c results. In this study, we describe two patients with IDDM, whose\nregularly determined HbA1c values were considerably decreased with the\nconcomitant use of two related sulfonamide drugs, sulfasalazine and dapsone. The \nfall in HbA1c results is explained by increased erythrocytopoiesis as a product\nof drug-induced hemolysis. Fructosamine concentrations are not affected by\nhemolysis and reflected glycemic control better. We conclude that under\nconditions of persistent (subclinical) hemolysis, as occurs during the use of\nsulfonamides, HbA1c is not a reliable indicator of glycemic control.\n\nPMID: 8799639  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In paediatric patients, the drug has been used to treat inflammatory\nbowel disease and is currently under investigation for the treatment of juvenile \nchronic arthritis. Although sulphasalazine has a rather low incidence of serious \nside effects, one of the most common is skin rash, thought to be an allergic\nreaction. In adults, sulphasalazine desensitization programmes have proven to be \neffective for the treatment of this side effect. We present the case of a\n7-year-old boy suffering from HLA-B 27 positive juvenile chronic arthritis. After\ninitiation of treatment with sulphasalazine he developed an allergic skin rash,\nbut tolerated the drug well after completion of a desensitization programme. To\nour knowledge, this is the first report of a paediatric patient with juvenile\nchronic arthritis successfully desensitized with sulphasalazine.\n\nPMID: 7488828  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Recently a severe allergic reaction and cases of\nlupus-like disease have been described in patients with RA after treatment with\nsulphasalazine. We describe five patients, all with inflammatory arthropathy who \ndeveloped cutaneous vasculitis, lupus-like disease or atypical serology after\nexposure to sulphasalazine. Three of four cases investigated were found to have\nthe slow acetylator phenotype. These reactions can complicate the diagnosis and\ndelay discontinuation of the drug.

She noticed polyarthralgia 8 months prior to the\nadmission and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was made. Administration of\nsalazosulfapyridine (1.0 g/day) was started 6 months before the admission.\nComplete remission of rheumatoid arthritis was obtained in 2 months and blood\ncell counts showed normal values at that time. The results of laboratory tests\nincluded hemoglobin; 8.6 g/dl, white blood cell count; 1,900/mm3 with a\ndifferential of 19% neutrophils, 77% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes; platelets\nwere 21,000/mm3. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. There were\nreduced numbers of myelocytes, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes indicating\naplastic anemia. Salazosulfapyridine was discontinued. Prednisolone, anabolic\nsteroid and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were administrated. In \nspite of these therapy, recovery of peripheral blood cell counts have not been\nobserved and supporting therapy including red cell and platelets transfusion have\nbeen continued. To our knowledge, this is the first case report which describes\noccurrence of aplastic anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated by\nsalazosulfapyridine.\n\nPMID: 7553032  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The SSZ induced antibodies were predominantly IgG against the \n(H2A-H2B)-DNA complex.

The first patient developed pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after more\nthan 4 yr of treatment for Crohn's disease. Pulmonary symptoms and chest\nroentgenographic and pulmonary function abnormalities gradually reversed after\nstopping the drug. No specific treatment was given. The second patient, who had\nrheumatoid arthritis without pulmonary disease, received the drug for 1 yr\nwithout experiencing any problems. Readministration seven months later resulted\nin the development of an acute interstitial pulmonary disease. Discontinuing the \ndrug and treatment with corticosteroids produced rapid improvement.

We report\nthe first case of a patient being treated for rheumatoid arthritis who developed \nsevere dyspnoea with chest radiograph shadowing, reversible on discontinuation of\nsulphasalazine and subsequent steroid therapy. An histological diagnosis of\nfibrosing alveolitis was made. Thirteen cases of similar reactions to\nsulphasalazine, all in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease, can be\nfound in the literature. We identify two types of pulmonary reaction, an\neosinophilic pneumonitis and a fibrosing alveolitis. Adequate histological\ninvestigation is needed to differentiate between the two and management may be\ndifferent. The diagnosis of pulmonary reactions are important because they can be\neasily confused with complications of the underlying disease but the prognosis is\nmuch better.\n\nPMID: 1972634  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Soon after the \nstart of this medication she developed progressive cough and shortness of breath.\nAfter two years she was referred for evaluation of a hemoptysis and a reddish\nskin lesion. The chest radiograph showed wide spread interstitial infiltrates in \nthe lower lobes and some fibrotic changes. FVC was slightly reduced, DLCO\nmarkedly reduced. There was a high percentage of eosinophils in the\nbronchoalveolar lavage (55.2%). Transbronchial lung biopsy and skin biopsy\ndemonstrated epitheloid granulomata. SSP was discontinued. After a short period\nof prednisone treatment the patient's condition improved considerably. After two \nmonths of followup neither pulmonary infiltrates nor any skin lesions were found.\nHistory and the clinical course after discontinuation of SSP indicate the\nrelation of these infiltrates to SSP treatment. The previously published case\nreports of SSP-related lung disorders are reviewed. Three of these case reports\nincluded bronchoalveolar lavage. Our data suggest that patients with SSP related \npulmonary infiltrates may have a marked increase of eosinophils in the\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n\nPMID: 1972576  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In three patients a favourable\neffect on the symptoms was noted. In one of these patients a year-long prednisone\ntreatment was withdrawn and replaced by sulphasalazine. In all these cases,\nhowever, a decrease was seen in leucocyte counts to subnormal levels after the\naddition of sulphasalazine to a basis therapy with azathioprine 150-200 mg/d\n(2.1-3.3 mg/kg). The effect was only transitory in two patients, while it lasted \nseveral months in the third. In a fourth patient agranulocytosis developed after \nfour days following the combined treatment with azathioprine 150 mg/d (2.3 mg/kg)\nand 250-1000 mg/d (4-15 mg/kg) of sulphasalazine, lasting four days before\nrecovery. A later resumption of the combination therapy with these same drugs,\nbut in a lower dosage, did not induce any acute changes in leucocyte counts. The \nskin rash provoked by sulphasalazine in two of the patients did not recur after\ndesensitization. It is concluded, that this combination therapy is valuable in\nadult Still's disease, but that caution should be exerted during the initiation\nof sulphasalazine therapy. This should be monitored by daily measurements of\nleucocyte counts in the first weeks and preferably started by the use of a\ndesensitising kit.\n\nPMID: 2887331  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Remarkably, in all six\ncases the relatively early hemogram alterations appear as soon as the start of\ntherapy and prompt normalization of blood counts occurs after instant termination\nof sulfasalazine therapy. Possible mechanisms for the occurrence of these\nsulfasalazine-induced hematological complications are discussed. These\nobservations, also described by other authors, should be a cause for more\nfrequent blood count tests during sulfasalazine therapy, at least during the\nfirst 3 months on a weekly basis. Sulfasalazine represents an asset among the\nrather limited number of basic therapies available for chronic rheumatoid\narthritis. Despite the fact that it is comparatively well tolerated, a close\nfollow-up of the therapy, especially during the initial phases of treatment, is\nof utmost importance in order to seize upon these reversible hematological\ndisorders at an early stage and thus avoid more serious complications.\n\nPMID: 2885991  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Report on 7 cases, possible\ntreatment and review of the literature].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nLang B, Weber S, Maas D.\n\nWarm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare but typical\nextraintestinal complication of ulcerative colitis. Seven cases with this\ncondition are reported here and 24 further cases from the literature are\nreviewed. There were no essential differences between the two groups of patients \nwith respect to clinical and immuno-hematological findings. However, the\nintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs has led to a change in therapy and\nprognosis in recent years. Our observations suggest that treatment with steroids \nand azathioprine is to be recommended, with accompanying therapy of the\nunderlying disease. In patients failing to respond to this immunosuppressive\nregimen, splenectomy or surgical treatment of the affected intestines must be\nconsidered. For every patient with ulcerative colitis and hyperregenerative\nanemia the possibility of warm autoantibody formation must be ruled out by\nperforming the direct antiglobulin test.\n\nPMID: 2862702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 23-year-old man was diagnosed as UC in January 1991 and had been \ntreated with salazosulfapyridine and prednisolone with good effect. In September \n1993, he developed bleeding tendency and a diagnosis of APL with disseminated\nintravascular coagulation was made based on the results of bone marrow aspiration\nand coagulation profile. Complete remission was achieved with All-trans retinoic \nacid together with combined chemotherapy. He died of sepsis during consolidation \nchemotherapy in December 1993. Autopsy revealed no recurrence of UC.\n\nPMID: 7563602  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Although assumed to have\ncandida endophthalmitis, vitrectomy demonstrated mycobacterium bovis. The patient\nwas placed on systemic anti-tuberculous therapy, and there was noted to be a\nreduction in retinal lesions prior to his death. This is the first report in the \nliterature documenting endogenous endophthalmitis after BCG usage.\n\nPMID: 3068750  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2007 Apr 19.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis in a patient with Turner syndrome: a case report.\n\nArmagan O(1), Ekim A, Dinc A, Oner C.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir\nOsmangazi University Medical School, Meselik Campus, 26480, Eskisehir, Turkey.\naoarmagan@superonline.com\n\nTurner's syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder where phenotypic females have\neither a missing chromosome (45 X0) or a structural aberration of one of the\nchromosomes. It is possible for TS to accompany such autoimmune diseases as\nthyroid diseases, inflammatory intestinal diseases, diabetes mellitus, psoriatic \narthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Herein, we present an unusual case\nwith Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and autoimmune thyroiditis associated with TS.\nWe suggest that the possibility that TS patients may also develop such other\ndiseases as AS apart from the already known accompanying autoimmune diseases\nshould not be ruled out when monitoring TS patients.\n\nPMID: 17443326  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Med J Aust. 1983 May 28;1(11):528-9.\n\nPossible teratogenicity of sulphasalazine.\n\nNewman NM, Correy JF.\n\nThree infants, born of two mothers with inflammatory bowel disease who received\ntreatment with sulphasalazine throughout pregnancy, were found to have major\ncongenital anomalies. In the singleton pregnancy, the mother had ulcerative\ncolitis, and the infant, a male, had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular\nseptal defect. In the twin pregnancy, the mother had Crohn's disease. The first\ntwin, a female, had a left Potter-type IIa polycystic kidney and a rudimentary\nleft uterine cornu. The second twin, a male, had some features of Potter's\nfacies, hypoplastic lungs, absent kidneys and ureters, and talipes equinovarus.\nDespite reports to the contrary, it is suggested that sulphasalazine may be\nteratogenic.\n\nPMID: 6133211  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two\nphenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations\nwithin the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT\ninterval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial\nfeatures, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of\nTS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have\ncortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted\nmutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS\nassociated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene\nmutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand\nboth the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nPMCID: PMC3319791\nPMID: 22106044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

She was born with\nmild dysmorphic features and common cardiac abnormalities. However, she\nre-presented at 2.5 months of age with a pericardial effusion. We decided to\nembark on a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids and salicylic acid therapy in an\nattempt to avoid pericardectomy. After 3 weeks of medical treatment the effusion \nresolved. This experience allows us to propose that medical management with\ncorticosteroids and salicylic acid can be considered as an alternative to\nsurgical therapy for CDGS-I patients with persistent pericardial effusions.\n\nPMID: 12170369  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sodium salicylate is the main therapeutic choice \nfor acute idiopathic pericarditis. In vitro studies have demonstrated the role\nplayed by sodium salicylate in the inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase, but, at therapeutic doses, this inhibition is not enough to\nexplain acetylsalicylic acid-induced hemolysis observed in vivo. We thus treated \na patient affected by acute idiopathic pericarditis and glucose 6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase deficiency with sodium salicylate, obtaining complete resolution of\nfever and symptoms, without any hemolytic complication. Therapy with sodium\nsalicylate could thus be a safe and effective alternative for patients with\nglucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase who require anti-inflammatory therapy.\n\nPMID: 10920507  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

South Med J. 1996 May;89(5):479-82.\n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by chronic salicylate\nintoxication.\n\nChalasani N(1), Roman J, Jurado RL.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Medicine, Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA\n30033, USA.\n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is characterized by body\ntemperature abnormalities, tachypnea or hyperventilation, tachycardia, and\nleukocytosis or leukopenia. Although it is typically associated with a serious\ninfection and referred to as sepsis, SIRS can stem from noninfectious causes, as \nwell. We report the cases of four patients with toxic serum levels of salicylate \n(33.5 to 67.6 mg/dL) and SIRS, and we discuss mechanisms responsible for SIRS.\nOur patients showed temperature disturbances (35.5 degrees C to 39.8 degrees C), \nnoncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and mixed acid base disturbances. Other\nabnormalities included coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation),\nencephalopathy, and hypotension. All four patients recovered from SIRS, probably \ndue to early recognition and treatment; only one patient did not survive the\nhospitalization. Chronic salicylate toxicity should be considered as a cause of\nSIRS in the absence of a source of infection, since survival appears to be\ndependent on prompt diagnosis and management.\n\nPMID: 8638172  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The cardiac rhythm returned \nto normal as the serum salicylate concentration decreased, and results of\nsubsequent electrophysiologic testing and Holter monitoring were normal. A low\nserum albumin level may have resulted in altered salicylate binding in this\npatient, thereby increasing the availability of unbound (active) drug for toxic\neffects.\n\nPMID: 3952006  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

South Med J. 1996 May;89(5):479-82.\n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by chronic salicylate\nintoxication.\n\nChalasani N(1), Roman J, Jurado RL.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Medicine, Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA\n30033, USA.\n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is characterized by body\ntemperature abnormalities, tachypnea or hyperventilation, tachycardia, and\nleukocytosis or leukopenia. Although it is typically associated with a serious\ninfection and referred to as sepsis, SIRS can stem from noninfectious causes, as \nwell. We report the cases of four patients with toxic serum levels of salicylate \n(33.5 to 67.6 mg/dL) and SIRS, and we discuss mechanisms responsible for SIRS.\nOur patients showed temperature disturbances (35.5 degrees C to 39.8 degrees C), \nnoncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and mixed acid base disturbances. Other\nabnormalities included coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation),\nencephalopathy, and hypotension. All four patients recovered from SIRS, probably \ndue to early recognition and treatment; only one patient did not survive the\nhospitalization. Chronic salicylate toxicity should be considered as a cause of\nSIRS in the absence of a source of infection, since survival appears to be\ndependent on prompt diagnosis and management.\n\nPMID: 8638172  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is commonly associated with cutaneous signs. Herein we\nreport a case of atypical cutaneous eruption occurring during the course of APS\nand we discuss the possible mechanism.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A 45-year-old woman consulted twice within six months for\nan erythematosus papular eruption around the neckline. She was being followed-up \nfor antiphospholipid syndrome treated with fluindione (Pr\xc3\xa9viscan\xc2\xae), and her\nInternational Normalized Ratio (INR) was consistent with the prescribed\nanticoagulation target. Blood tests confirmed the presence of anticardiolipin and\nantiphospholipid antibodies, but no laboratory evidence of lupus was seen.\nHistopathological examination of a skin biopsy demonstrated the presence within\nthe vascular lumen of a weakly eosinophilic anhistic substance positive for PAS\nstain. The patient was given acetone salicylic acid (Kard\xc3\xa9gic\xc2\xae) combined with\nfluindione, and four years later, she had presented no relapses.\nDISCUSSION: Despite a clinically evocative appearance, the diagnosis of lupus\ntumidus was ruled out in our patient by histopathological features, and\nassociated systemic lupus erythematosus was repeatedly refuted on the basis of\nclinical and laboratory data. We suggest that the specific histological images of\nintraluminal deposits within the dermal vessels seen in this patient, although\nnot typical of thrombosis, are associated with APS. The clinical remission seen\nfrom the start of antiplatelet treatment could be due to the action of these\ndrugs against the obstruction of small-calibre dermal vessels.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A clinical case was reviewed for its initial\npresentation, planning of treatment strategy and outcome. A secondary literature \nsearch for discussion on current accepted recommendations for primary\naortoenteric fistula was then completed. Aortoenteric fistulas are rare\npathologies with highly morbid potential. Their diagnosis requires a high index\nof suspicion and prompt intervention is critical to patient survival. In\nconclusion, aortoenteric fistula most commonly arises from large atherosclerotic \naneurysms but can be caused by systemic infection.

Echocardiography revealed a circular pericardial effusion and\nglobal hypokinesia. Pericardiocentesis showed a purulent exudate and\nmicrobiologic examination revealed Mycobacterium bovis fully sensitive to\nisoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. By spoligotyping\nthe isolate could be further differentiated to M. bovis ssp. caprae.\nAntimycobacterial therapy was initiated but 3 weeks later the patient's\ncirculation and renal function deteriorated and he died with clinical signs of\nsepsis despite intensive care treatment. Pericarditis is a rare manifestation of \ntuberculosis and can be fatal even when diagnosed and treated appropriately. In\nlow incidence countries diagnosis is often delayed and even overlooked.\n\nPMID: 14522518  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

At the time of\noperation, no gross evidence of infection was found and pathologic examination of\nthe aortic wall was unremarkable. Aortic graft infection with BCG was diagnosed 1\nyear after placement of the graft. Retrospective examination of formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded aortic wall and thrombus removed at the time of graft placement\nby the polymerase chain reaction technique demonstrated the presence of\nmycobacterial DNA. The patient's condition improved with medical therapy during\nan observation period of 18 months with near total resolution on computed\ntomography scanning. Ultimately (20 months later), an aortoenteric fistula\ndeveloped that required graft removal and axillobifemoral bypass.\n\nPMID: 7602717  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Metoclopramide was used as an\nantiemetic. During the second therapy cycle sudden severe vascular collapse with \nincreasing hepatomegaly and signs of acute hepatic failure occurred leading to\ndeath after two days. At necropsy a Budd-Chiari syndrome with thombosed hepatic\nveins and congestive liver parenchyma necroses was found. The cause was\nhyperergic endophlebitis combined with severe infiltration of the vascular walls \nby eosinophilic granulocytes. In association with 5 more similar cases from other\nclinics (personal communications) this picture must be assumed to be a\ncomplication of dacarbazine treatment.\n\nPMID: 6986251  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The eruption flared whenever the patient\nreceived low doses of prednisone to control symptoms of temporal arteritis. A\ncervical lymph node biopsy specimen demonstrated acid-fast bacilli, and\nMycobacterium bovis grew on the cultures. The eruption cleared completely with\nantituberculous therapy. This case demonstrated the clinicopathologic findings\ncompatible with a diagnosis of papulonecrotic tuberculid. Skepticism regarding\nthe existence of papulonecrotic tuberculid is probably a result of the current\ndecreased prevalence of untreated tuberculosis, and the subsequently increased\nrarity of this entity.\n\nPMID: 348113  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Am J Clin Dermatol. 2008;9(6):404-9. doi: 10.2165/0128071-200809060-00009.\n\nTransient reactive papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma in a 50-year-old woman: case\nreport and review of the literature.\n\nAdi\xc5\x9fen E(1), Karaca F, G\xc3\xbcrer MA.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Be\xc5\x9fevler,\nAnkara, Turkey. eozsoy@gazi.edu.tr\n\nA 50-year-old woman who presented with intermittent symmetric edema and wrinkling\nof the palms after soaking in water was found to have transient reactive\npapulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (TRPA). This is the oldest patient ever\nreported to have this condition. The patient was advised to avoid water exposure \nas much as possible and to wear gloves. Topical treatment with 5% salicylic acid \nin Vaseline also provided some relief. TRPA presents with translucent, white,\nconfluent papules that become evident on the palms after 3-5 minutes' exposure to\nwater (the so-called 'hand-in-the-bucket' sign) and resolve within a short time\nafter drying. It is a rare disorder with fewer than 40 cases having been reported\nin the world literature. The disease is seen mostly in female patients, with ages\nranging from 6 to 44 years prior to our case in a 50-year-old woman. The most\ncommon histologic findings are hyperkeratosis and dilated eccrine ostia. The\netiopathogenesis of the disease remains unknown but a transitory structural or\nfunctional alteration of components of the stratum corneum or aberration of the\nsweat duct have been considered. TRPA has been reported in patients with cystic\nfibrosis and more recently, in patients taking selective cyclo-oxygenase-2\ninhibitors. Therefore, the pathogenesis of the condition appears to be related to\nincreased water absorption as a result of an increased epidermal sodium level.\nTreatment with barrier creams such as hydrophilic petrolatum, glycerin\nemollients, 5-20% salicylic acid in Vaseline, 10% urea cream, and 12% ammonium\nlactate cream have been reported. Cases with associated hyperhidrosis respond\nwell to aluminum chloride-containing products.\n\nPMID: 18973409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

An elderly man presented with multiple fungating growths,\nwhich were painless but associated with mild itching and serous discharge, on the\nright foot for 40 years. The lesions were free from deeper structures and no\ninguinal lymphadenopathy was observed. A provisional diagnosis of epithelioma was\nmade based on the features described. However, incisional biopsy indicated that\nthe lesions were tuberculous. As part of the anti-tubercular therapy, the lesions\nwere excised and the wounds covered with split-thickness skin graft. The\npatient's recovery was uneventful, with no graft loss or infection reported. This\ncase illustrates the importance of recognising cutaneous forms of tuberculosis,\nespecially TVC, as an important differential diagnosis of epithelioma.\n\nPMID: 23546037  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The genetic and phenotypic correlation \nhas been described.\nMETHODS: We report a unique clinical presentation and the identification of a\nnovel missense mutation in the NEMO gene in a 3-year-old boy with bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin (BCG) infection.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and abnormal\nanti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers, suggestive of EBV-related diseases\nincluding chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, or\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although the biopsy specimen from a nasopharyngeal\nlesion was initially diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, this was changed to\ndisseminated BCG infection involving the nasopharynx, multiple systemic lymph\nnodes, and brain. A novel mutation (designated D311E) in the NEMO gene, located\nin the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain, was identified as the underlying\ncause of the immunodeficiency. Impaired immune responses which are characteristic\nof patients with NEMO deficiency were demonstrated. The patient underwent\nsuccessful unrelated bone marrow transplantation at 4.9\xc2\xa0years of age.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of the NUB domain in host defense \nagainst mycobacteria. The unique presenting features in our patient indicate that\na hypomorphic NEMO mutation can be associated with atypical pathological findings\nof the epithelial tissues in patients with BCG infection.\n\nPMID: 21755389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

This report presents the case of a\n56-year-old man who presented with multiorgan failure after bacille\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) treatment for stage T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the\nbladder. On admission the patient was jaundiced, had inflammatory infiltrates on \nchest radiography and required dialysis for renal failure. He had a persisting\nfever of unknown origin and elevated cholestatic liver function tests, which\nprompted a liver biopsy.This demonstrated hypersensitivity hepatic granuloma but \nno organism was identified. He responded well to steroid and antimycobacterial\ntreatment. A small percentage of BCG-treated patients suffer hypersensitivity\nside-effects (pneumonitis, hepatitis or interstitial nephritis). This\ncomplication most commonly follows a traumatic installation. Mycobacteriumbovis\nis rarely cultured or identified using polymerase chain reaction techniques, and \nthe diagnosis is based on histological findings of granuloma.\n\nPMID: 21329482  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Chest CT showed bilateral\ninfiltration of the lungs. Patient was placed on anti-tuberculosis treatment\nincluding isoniazid, rifampycin, ethambutol and methylprednisolone initially; and\nthis treatment was adjusted according to his clinical course and liver function\ntests. By the end of the 4th week of hospitalisation patient was responded well\nwith normalisation of his clinical status, liver function tests and a normal\nchest X-ray. Thereafter, he was discharged home on isoniazid, ethambutol for 6\nmonths, streptomycin, cycloserine-C and ofloxacin for 2 months,\nmethylprednisolone which was stopped eventually after dose reduction. On\nfollow-up at 6th month after discharge from the hospital, he was fully recovered \nwith normal chest X-ray and blood tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Development of severe sepsis is inevitable following inadvertent\nintravascular BCG administration. Therefore, urologists should warn and inform\nnot only their patients and families but also healthcare workers such as nurses\nregarding the route of administration of the BCG treatment for bladder cancer.\nOur experience also proved that such a serious complication can be successfully\ntreated if promptly acted.\n\nPMID: 21317964  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Comparison of this case with 2 other reported\ncases reveals a similar pattern of elderly, debilitated and immunocompromised\npatients with poor response to systemic antituberculous therapy in whom systemic \nsteroids are used concurrently. Age and glucocorticoids are known to lead to\nthymic involution, reduce cell mediated immunity, and a lowering in the number of\nnaive T cells capable of mounting an effective defense to new infectious agents.\nCONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be aware of the potential for ocular complications\nof BCG immunotherapy in the elderly, immunocompromised, on oral steroids.\n\nPMID: 18569795  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

BCG-mediated anti-tumor\nactivity appears to be a local phenomenon in which cell-mediated immunity,\ninvolving cytotoxic T cells, lymphokine-activated killer cells and natural killer\ncells, is important for the elimination of malignant cells. Serious side-effects \nof BCG therapy are rare; nevertheless, BCG is a live, attenuated strain of\nMycobacterium (M.) bovis and may exhibit invasive properties. Both local and\ndistant or generalized infections have been reported after treatment with BCG. We\ndescribe the case of a 68-year-old man who developed bone marrow infection with\nBCG two years after intravesical instillation of BCG for treatment of superficial\nbladder cancer. He presented with intermittent fever, weight loss and pronounced \npancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed granulomatous inflammation and\nBCG was cultured from the urine. Anti-mycobacterial treatment with isoniazid,\nrifampicin and ethambutol (pyrazinamide is inactive against M. bovis) led to full\nclinical recovery of the patient.\n\nPMID: 18322775  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A rare but \nsevere complication of BCG immunotherapy is the development of disseminated BCG\ndisease, which can result in miliary pneumonitis, granulomatous hepatitis, soft\ntissue infections, bone marrow involvement, and sepsis. Symptoms can present as\nearly as a few hours or as late as several months following the BCG therapy. The \nkey finding in disseminated BCG disease is the formation of caseating granulomas \nin distant organs; detection of BCG organisms from tissue samples can be\ndifficult. Recommended treatment for disseminated BCG disease includes a\ncombination of antituberculous medications (with the exception of pyrazinamide,\nto which BCG is typically resistant) and a tapering course of steroids. We\npresent the cases of four patients who developed granulomatous infection\nconsistent with disseminated disease after intravesical BCG treatment and provide\na summary of current clinical management recommendations.\n\nPMID: 18176300  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Occasionally, BCG infection\ncomplicates such treatment. In some patients, infection appears early (within 3\nmonths after instillation) and is characterized by generalized symptoms, with\npneumonitis and hepatitis. Late-presentation disease occurs >1 year after the\nfirst BCG treatment and usually involves focal infection of the genitourinary\ntract (the site at which bacteria were introduced) and/or other sites that are\ntypical for reactivation of mycobacterial disease, such as the vertebral spine or\nthe retroperitoneal tissues. Noncaseating granulomas are found in the majority of\ncases, whether early or late. Most patients respond to treatment with\nantituberculous drugs; in early-presentation disease, when features of\nhypersensitivity predominate, glucocorticosteroids are sometimes added. Late\nlocalized infection often requires surgical resection.\n\nPMID: 12522745  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The records of all patients were\nreviewed to determine the incidence of caseating granulomata containing acid-fast\nbacilli together with the incidence of toxicity and the outcome of treatment.\nRESULTS: Five patients were found to have persisting acid-fast mycobacteria in\ntheir urine or bladder up to 16.5 months after completing intravesical\ninstillations of BCG. In one patient this probably accounted for bladder symptoms\nthat required palliative cystectomy. In four patients the 'infection' was not\nsevere.

The first patient, who was seropositive for the human\nimmunodeficiency virus, developed bilateral interstitial pneumonitis after\ninstillation of BCG into the bladder. The second patient developed a\nright-lower-lobe infiltrate and empyema after instillation of BCG into the right \nrenal pelvis. The clinical isolates from these two patients and from a third\npatient with a psoas abscess following intravesical instillation were analyzed\nwith use of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to resolve chromosomal\nrestriction fragment polymorphisms. The clinical isolates were confirmed to be\nBCG by comparison with known vaccine strains that differed from M. bovis\nisolates. We conclude that the potential for subsequent dissemination be\nconsidered prior to the intravesical administration of BCG. Analysis with PFGE\nmay be useful for identifying species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.\n\nPMID: 8104511  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

He\nwas treated with 1 g salazosulfapyridine (SASP) daily for two years.\nHematological investigations conducted since 2005 demonstrated hemoglobin\nconcentrations of 8 approximately 9 g/dl, which then dropped to 4.9 g/dl on\nNovember 21, 2007, following which he was admitted to our hospital. Megaloblastic\nanemia associated with SASP treatment and anemia of chronic disorders were\ndiagnosed on the basis of folate deficiency and bone marrow examination. This\nreport describes a case of megaloblastic anemia, which developed two years after \nstarting SASP and promptly recovered after its withdrawal and treatment with\nfolic acid and prednisolone. The doses of SASP prescribed for RA in Japan are\nless than those prescribed abroad. Megaloblastic anemia associated with SASP\ntreatment for RA is not usually detected in Japan. Currently, SASP is widely used\nand one of the key drugs in the treatment of RA. This case suggests that SASP\ntherapy in RA might result in megaloblastic anemia.\n\nPMID: 19110522  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Report on 7 cases, possible\ntreatment and review of the literature].\n\n[Article in German]\n\nLang B, Weber S, Maas D.\n\nWarm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare but typical\nextraintestinal complication of ulcerative colitis. Seven cases with this\ncondition are reported here and 24 further cases from the literature are\nreviewed. There were no essential differences between the two groups of patients \nwith respect to clinical and immuno-hematological findings. However, the\nintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs has led to a change in therapy and\nprognosis in recent years. Our observations suggest that treatment with steroids \nand azathioprine is to be recommended, with accompanying therapy of the\nunderlying disease. In patients failing to respond to this immunosuppressive\nregimen, splenectomy or surgical treatment of the affected intestines must be\nconsidered. For every patient with ulcerative colitis and hyperregenerative\nanemia the possibility of warm autoantibody formation must be ruled out by\nperforming the direct antiglobulin test.\n\nPMID: 2862702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A Heidelberg scanning laser ophthalmoscope was used for fundus\nfluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography. Retinal\nneovascularization was detected during the follow-up.\nRESULTS: Successful regression of retinal neovascularization was achieved after\nargon green laser panretinal photocoagulation in addition to oral steroid and\nsalazopyrine.\nCONCLUSION: Retinal vascular involvement is a rare ocular feature of Crohn's\ndisease and may result in retinal neovascularization that may necessitate prompt \nlaser photocoagulation.\n\nPMID: 12201349  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

With numerous differential diagnoses, an early accurate\ndiagnosis can be challenging. infectious causes are the most important to exclude\nin a timely manner and drug rash and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nis another differential diagnosis that should be considered in children. This\nhypersensitivity reaction is associated with multisystem involvement. Children\nwith underlying chronic diseases may have impairment of normal metabolic pathways\nand are also often on multiple medications. Therefore, drugs should always be\nconsidered in the aetiopathology of any new symptoms and signs. This case report \ninforms readers of the association of sulfasalazine and DRESS in an 11-year-old\nwith inflammatory bowel disease and discusses its pathogenesis and treatment.\nIncreased awareness of this disorder will hopefully lead to increased reporting\nand consequently illuminate the syndrome more clearly and help guide its\nprevention and treatment.\n\nPMID: 20546480  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We report here a case \nof mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder associated with primary\nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old female\nhad been treated with salazosulfapyridine and ursodesoxycholic acid becase of UC \nand PSC. After 7 years of treatment, laboratory data showed that the liver\nfunction took a turn for the worse, and the patient was admitted to our hospital \nfor further examination. Enhanced computed tomography and ultrasonography showed \nan enlarged gallbladder associated with wall thickening and diffuse papillary\nprotrusion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis and dilatation \nof the bile duct, which were compatible with PSC. Under the diagnosis of an early\ncarcinoma of the gallbladder, we performed simple cholecystectomy. The tumor\nshowed a papillary growth pattern located diffusely in the gallbladder with a\nmassive amount of mucin filling the gallbladder. Histologically, it was diagnosed\nas a papillary adenocarcinoma localized in the mucosal layer. To the best of our \nknowledge, this is the first case of mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder\nassociated with PSC and UC. PSC and UC patients should be regarded as a high-risk\ngroup not only for cholangiocarcinoma but also carcinoma of the gallbladder.\n\nPMID: 19096754  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1998 Aug;13(8):825-9.\n\nThree paediatric cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis treated with\nursodeoxycholic acid and sulphasalazine.\n\nKozaiwa K(1), Tajiri H, Sawada A, Tada K, Etani Y, Miki K, Okada S.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.\nkozaiwa@ped.med.osaka-u.ac.jp\n\nWe present here three paediatric patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In\ncase 1, the serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was decreased only temporarily by\nursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment and 34 months later, sulphasalazine was\nadded because of microscopic colitis. The enzyme level decreased with dual\ntherapy. Similarly, in case 3, first diagnosed as autoimmune hepatitis, the\ntranspeptidase levels remained elevated for 18 months during treatment with UDCA,\nprednisolone and mizoribin. The enzyme decreased only after a diagnosis of\nprimary sclerosing cholangitis complicated with ulcerative colitis was\nestablished and sulphasalazine was introduced. Case 2 also had Crohn's colitis\nand was put on UDCA and sulphasalazine from the start. The enzyme level was\nnormalized within 1 month and has remained normal for the following 5 years.\nLiver biopsies were analysed repeatedly in these three patients. In case 1,\nperiductal fibrosis remained unchanged while being treated by UDCA. There\nappeared to be no progression in liver cirrhosis in case 3 while being treated by\nUDCA, prednisolone, and mizoribin. In case 2, who has been treated with both UDCA\nand sulphasalazine from the start, periductal fibrosis and portal fibrosis were\nremarkably improved 45 months later. We suggest that sulphasalazine in addition\nto UDCA might be a viable treatment for children with primary sclerosing\ncholangitis.\n\nPMID: 9736177  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

X-ray examination revealed sclerosis of the right sacroiliac\njoint, and of the 6th lumbar vertebra. An NMR examination revealed a diffuse\nsignal loss in the region of the 6th lumbar vertebra. On account of the\nprogressive increase in liver transaminases in the serum, an ERCP was carried\nout, which confirmed the suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Severe\naxial arthritis and PSC with underlying clinically inactive ulcerative colitis\nwas diagnosed, and treatment with salazosulfapyridine and ursodeoxycholic acid\ninitiated. This led to freedom from pain within a matter of weeks and an\nappreciable reduction in serum cholestasis parameters.\n\nPMID: 7903077  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In most cases, this\ndisease is the result of reactivation and secondary hematogenous spread of a\nlatent infection. Although the suspected diagnosis is given by clinical\nmanifestations and analysis of ascitic fluid (lymphocytic predominance, albumin\ngradient between serum and ascitic fluid 1g/dl and adenosine deaminase\nconcentration > or = 39 U/L), microbiologic assessment is required for the\ndefinitive diagnosis. Mycobacterium bovis causes tuberculosis in animals.\nTransmission to humans is rare in developed areas, given that it usually occurs\nthrough ingestion of unpasteurized contaminated milk. We present a patient with\ncirrhosis who developed ascites caused by an exceptional infection in our\nsetting.\n\nPMID: 19577339  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We report a case of\ndisseminated mycobacterial infection, following BCG vaccination, in a child who\nlater developed tuberculosis. Functional tests and a novel diagnostic polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) assay, revealed a loss-of-function deletion in the IL12\ngene. Analysis of samples from the parents and siblings of the patient indicated \nan autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with varying degrees of phenotypic\nexpression in identical genotypes. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) therapy was\nassociated with marked clinical improvement. Biliary cirrhosis, a hitherto\nunreported complication of IL-12 deficiency, developed later and required liver\ntransplantation. A defect in the IL-12-IFN-gamma pathway should be suspected in\npatients presenting with multiple, repeated or persistent infection with\nintracellular bacteria. The diagnostic work-up and the immuno-genetic assay\ndescribed here can aid in the quick and reliable diagnosis of IL-12 deficiency\nresulting from genetic defects and its subsequent management.\n\nPMID: 18204084  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Given the clinical findings, and awaiting for the bacterial \nculture result, a triple treatment with tuberculostatics was started, but had to \nbe discontinued because of hepatic toxicity. After culture of cutaneous biopsy\nyielded micobaterium tuberculosis, treatment with streptomycin, rifampicin and\netambutol was restarted. Three weeks later, in spite of increasing hydrocortisone\ndose to 40 mg, adrenal insufficiency reappeared. Under the circumstances, we\nchose to continue rifampicin and double hydrocortisone dose. The case is of\nconcern because of the concurrency of three nowadays infrequent disorders:\ntuberculous ethiology adrenal insufficiency, cutaneous tuberculosis due to\nmycobacterium bovis and primary adrenal insufficiency due to rifampicin\ntreatment, the latter resolved after increasing hydrocortisone dose.\n\nPMID: 18279000  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Bull Tokyo Med Dent Univ. 1979 Mar;26(1):43-55.\n\nPhytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test. Characterization of immunological properties \nand clinical application.\n\nNishido T.\n\nImmunological properties of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin reaction were\ninvestigated by animal and clinical experiments. In the guinea pigs an\nintradermal dose of PHA-P produced erythema and induration with a maximal\nresponse at 24 hours after the injection. Histologically it was characterized by \nperivascular infiltration of lymphoid cells in the dermis and subcutis, being\nsimilar to that of tuberculin (PPD) skin reaction. PHA skin reaction, however,\nshowed some difference from that of PPD in the initial cellular response in that \nthe former was composed of small mononuclear cells and granulocytes with rapid\ndevelopment and the latter was composed of large mononuclear cells (macrophages) \nand granulocytes with slow development. Intradermal injection of 1:1000 dilution \nof PHA-P produced a similar erythema in man. In 39 of 59 patients with connective\ntissue diseases, the results of the in vivo (skin test) and in vitro (lymphocyte \ntransformation) response to PHA correlated well. In the 59 patients, the\nincidence of the positive rate of the PHA tests (55.9%) was significantly higher \nthan that of the DNCB test (33.9%) and of the PPD test (23.7%). These\nobservations suggest that the PHA skin test has properties of delayed\nhypersensitivity and is highly sensitive and that it may be a useful measure of\ncell-mediated immunity.\n\nPMID: 371848  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Andrea University Hospital, Rome, Italy. pyke@inwind.it\n\nSecondary resistance may be a major problem in the management of autoimmune\ndiseases. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-function has been described as a mechanism\nof drug resistance in autoimmune patients. P-gp function can in vitro be\ninhibited by cyclosporine A (CSA) and verapamil; moreover, P-gp reduction by CSA \nin systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated.\nHere, P-gp function before and after CSA administration in three psoriatic\narthritis (PsA) patients, who developed a resistance to MTX/SSA, has been\nevaluated. P-gp function on patient cells was analyzed by measuring the changes\nin rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) fluorescence after verapamil incubation. CSA treatment \nresulted in good clinical outcome that was related with a significant P-gp\nfunction reduction at CD3+ and CD8+ levels. In addition to its immunosuppressive \nactivity, CSA results may also be related to MTX/SSA effect restoration through\nP-gp inhibition. This is the first time that CSA has been demonstrated as being\nable to revert MTX/SSA resistance in PsA.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As a rule, drugs and dosages are minimized in these patients. Among\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, cyclosporine and sulphasalazine are\npreferred. Methotrexate and leflunomide are strictly contraindicated and must be \nwithdrawn 3 months or 2 years, respectively, before a pregnancy is planned.\nPsoriatic arthritis may be treated during pregnancy with glucocorticosteroids,\nespecially with prednisone or prednisolone. We present the case ofa 40-year-old\ngravida with psoriatic arthritis which exacerbated during the first trimester of \npregnancy. Therapeutic implications in such cases are discussed.\n\nPMID: 21365940  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Two weeks after starting treatment, a high degree, subcontinuous fever\noccurred, together with systemic discomfort, fatigue, headache, and ultimately a \nmoderate wakefulness impairment. Upon admission to the hospital, a malar rash\nbecame evident. Modest notes of hepatotoxicity were also evident. All of the\nsymptoms suddenly resolved after SSZ withdrawal. The markers of hepatitis become \nnegative just 2 months later. It is interesting to note that after dismissal, in \norder to counteract the severe arthritic conditions and the presence of a type 2 \ndiabetes, a combined therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporin had to be used,\nwith no renal or hepatic side effects and remarkable therapeutic effects. No\nmarkers of autoimmunity were found in this patient. The chronology and the\nclinical events here described may confirm the hypothesis of a idiosyncratic\nreaction to SSZ, closely resembling a rare, sometimes irreversible, condition\nknown as "the 3 week sulphasalazine syndrome".\n\nPMID: 14976471  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It is characterized by the trias of psoriatic onychosis,\ntender soft tissue thickening, and osteoperiostitis of the distal phalanges in\nthe absence of distal interphalangeal arthritis. Recommendations for the\ntreatment of symptomatic POPP are not available.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: Treatment of a symptomatic 49-year old male.\nMETHODS: Sulfasalazine 1000mg b.i.d., p.o. for 8 months followed by radiotherapy \nof both hands with 6x0.5 Gy.\nRESULTS: No clinical response was observed with either of the two treatments.\nCONCLUSIONS: The course of this single case does not support sulfasalazine\ntreatment or radiotherapy in psoriatic onycho-pachydermo-periostitis.\n\nPMID: 12399890  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis, eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis.\nTreatment consisted of withdrawing the two drugs and topical steroids. The\nclinical signs regressed in 6 days. An increase in eosinophilia and hepatic\ncytolysis was observed until the tenth day, after which the trend reversed.\nLaboratory parameters were normal on the twentieth day. One month later,\nphotopatch testing was performed. A patch test with sulfanilamide irradiated with\nUVA was positive. Clinical and laboratory findings were highly suggestive of drug\nhypersensitivity syndrome. The positive result from the UVA photopatch test with \nsulfanilamide suggests that sulfasalazopyridine was involved in the occurrence of\nhypersensitivity syndrome in our patient. We conclude that photodistributed\neruptions can be observed in drug hypersensitivity syndrome with photosensitizing\ndrugs.\n\nPMID: 10449939  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the last ten years, there have been a few rare case\nreports of physical trauma precipitating psoriasic arthritis. We observed two\nsuch cases following an occupational accident discovered one and a half year and \ntwo and a half year after onset of the first clinical manifestations. In the\nfirst case, a 43-year-old man had a fracture of the right calcaneus in March\n1991. He was treated with nailing and also required emergency surgery of the\nposterior tibial artery. The tibiotarsal joint was normal radiologically. Pain\npersisted after treatment and in 1993 he presented with psoriasis of the scalp\nand several other localizations together with Hallopeau's acrodermatitis continua\nof the ankle, pathognomonic for psoriasic arthritis. Salazosufapyridin was given.\nThe second case was a 50-year-old man who had major pain in both wrists\nimmediately after falling on the palm of his hands in 1992. Bilateral carpal\ntunnel syndrome developed which did not respond well to surgery. In 1993, he\ndeveloped inflammatory synovitis and also had psoriasis mainly located at the\nelbows. Immunological tests were negative. Cortisone and salazosulfapyridin were \nnot particularly effective and the patient later developed arthritis of the hip\nand ankle joints. Physicians should be aware of physical trauma as a causative\nfactor in psoriasic arthritis due to the potential legal implications. Criteria\nfor imputability are: single major physical trauma, absence of clinical signs\nprior to the trauma, continuous clinical course, first signs occurring then\npredominating at the joint exposed to trauma. The pathophysiology of this type of\narthritis is not well understood. Deep Koebner's phenomena could be involved.\nActivation of substance P has also been hypothesized.\n\nPMID: 8728887  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We report here a case \nof mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder associated with primary\nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old female\nhad been treated with salazosulfapyridine and ursodesoxycholic acid becase of UC \nand PSC. After 7 years of treatment, laboratory data showed that the liver\nfunction took a turn for the worse, and the patient was admitted to our hospital \nfor further examination. Enhanced computed tomography and ultrasonography showed \nan enlarged gallbladder associated with wall thickening and diffuse papillary\nprotrusion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis and dilatation \nof the bile duct, which were compatible with PSC. Under the diagnosis of an early\ncarcinoma of the gallbladder, we performed simple cholecystectomy. The tumor\nshowed a papillary growth pattern located diffusely in the gallbladder with a\nmassive amount of mucin filling the gallbladder. Histologically, it was diagnosed\nas a papillary adenocarcinoma localized in the mucosal layer. To the best of our \nknowledge, this is the first case of mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder\nassociated with PSC and UC. PSC and UC patients should be regarded as a high-risk\ngroup not only for cholangiocarcinoma but also carcinoma of the gallbladder.\n\nPMID: 19096754  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The diagnosis was confirmed by macroscopic and\nhistopathological examination of lung tissue removed by surgery. Subsequent\nbacteriological examination showed the infection to have been caused by BCG. The \npossibility is discussed of whether the condition had developed from a metastatic\nlesion following BCG vaccination, or was the result of an aerogenic infection\nduring the production of BCG vaccine. The simultaneous development of the\ntuberculous condition and the tumour is remarkable but is not discussed further. \nThe requirements of WHO when signs of tuberculosis are found in a worker in a BCG\nlaboratory were complied with in this instance, but it was not considered\nnecessary to change the routine procedure in the BCG Department.\n\nPMCID: PMC2366676\nPMID: 340075  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2012 Nov\n20.\n\nPostoperative spondylodiscitis caused by Mycobacterium bovis BCG: a case study.\n\nR\xc3\xa4tsep T.\n\nAuthor information: \nDepartment of Neurology and Neurosurgery, University of Tartu, L. Puusepa 8,\n51014 Tartu, Estonia. tonu.ratsep@kliinikum.ee\n\nBACKGROUND CONTEXT: Postoperative spondylodiscitis (PSD) is a known complication \nof lumbar disc surgery. The etiology of the disease is usually bacterial, but\nseveral uncommon infectious agents have also been described; however, there are\nno reports about postoperative colonization with Mycobacterium bovis bacille\nCalmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin after lumbar discectomy.\nPURPOSE: To describe the case of PSD caused by M. bovis BCG, and to discuss\ndiagnostic and therapeutic interventions as well as possible pathogenic\nmechanisms of the disease.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case report and review of the literature.\nMETHODS: A 31-year-old man was operated on because of L4-L5 lumbar disc\nherniation. Two months later, the patient presented with gradual increase of back\npain, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed PSD. He started to receive\nantibacterial treatment and was reoperated on because of progressive neurological\ndeficits due to epidural abscess. Neurological status improved, but a fistula\ndeveloped with intermittent pus drainage from the operative scar.\nRESULTS: Microbiological cultures were repeatedly obtained from the pus, but all \nthe initial stains and cultures were negative. Four months after the reoperation,\nthe culture for M. bovis BCG from the pus appeared to be positive. The patient\nreceived antituberculosis regimen, including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and\nofloxacin. The clinical symptoms resolved, and antituberculosis treatment was\ndiscontinued after 14 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium bovis BCG must be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of PSD. Microbiological analysis and radiological studies are vital\ncomponents in diagnosis; if there is any suspicion of BCG osteomyelitis, proper\ndiagnostic and therapeutic management must be instituted without delay to avoid\nan unfavorable outcome.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

BCG vaccine contains live attenuated strain of\nMycobacterium bovis. Intravesical BCG is also effective in treatment of\ntransitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Complications after\nintravesical BCG immunotherapy are extremely rare. We report an iliac muscle\nabscess due to M bovis that developed 4 years after intravesical BCG therapy for \nbladder cancer. Infection with M bovis, though rare, should be considered in\npatients with prior BCG therapy for bladder cancer.\n\nPMID: 20224496  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Past\nmedical history revealed transurethral resection of bladder cancer followed by\nmultiple intravesical BCG instillation 12 years ago. Imaging studies of the\nthoracolumbar spine showed osteolysis of the L3 and L4 vertebrae and the\nassociated intervertebral disc space, and a large soft tissue mass with signal\nabnormalities suggesting of an abscess. CT-guided needle biopsy showed\nMycobacterium bovis infection. A triple anti-tuberculous chemotherapy regimen\nincluding isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol was administered for 12 months.\nSurgical treatment included drainage of the abscess and L2-L5 spinal\ninstrumentation and fusion. Intravesical BCG therapy may be complicated by late\ndisseminated disease to the bone even many years after initial BCG therapy.\nPatients having BCG therapy should be closely evaluated thereafter for the\npossibility of hematogenous spread of mycobacteria to distant sites.\n\nPMID: 19303342  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In patients with immunodeficiency syndrome, it\nusually presents as a systemic illness. We present the case of a woman with AIDS \nand disseminated TBC caused by M. bovis.

The prevalence of tuberculosis in Taiwan is higher than the\nWorld Health Organization standard. However, reports of M. bovis infection are\nrare. A 47-year-old male had the habit of drinking uncooked fresh deer's blood\nand unpasteurized deer's milk. He suffered from acute abdominal pain and\nunderwent emergency laparotomy. Pathology demonstrated tuberculosis enteritis\nwith colon perforation. The molecular diagnosis by nested polymerase chain\nreaction assay and single-strand conformation polymorphism assay showed M. bovis \ninfection in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). Our results suggest that the most likely portal of entry of M. bovis is\nthe gastrointestinal rather than the respiratory tract. Ingested M. bovis from\nunpasteurized deer's milk probably entered the mucosal macrophages of the\nintestine and then the draining mesenteric lymph nodes. As immunity declined,\nbacilli from the mesenteric lymph nodes disseminated to other organs and into the\nCSF.\n\nPMID: 15253472  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

It is still a widely used\nanti-inflammatory agent especially in the treatment of rheumatologic disorders\nand inflammatory bowel diseases. Most of its side effects are benign, tolerable, \nand dose dependent, but less common severe systemic reactions have also been\nrevealed.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was\nadmitted to emergency service because of status epilepticus. Hepatitis and\nmyelotoxicity were also present after laboratory investigations. The patient was \non sulfasalazine treatment for 3 weeks with a daily dose of 2g. Cranial magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral periventricular and subcortical\nlesions in the white matter of especially temporal and occipital regions.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed very high protein level (564 mg/L). \nAfter discontinuation of treatment, the clinical, CSF, and MRI findings regressed\nrapidly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Side effects of sulfasalazine include neurotoxicity such as status\nepilepticus, cranial MRI lesions, and CSF abnormalities that were diagnosed in\nour patient after excluding other etiologic factors causing encephalitis.\n\nPMID: 19050416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

It can affect the penis and is variable in presentation and onset\nin relation to bowel symptoms. It has been treated with oral, topical, systemic, \nand surgical therapies. We describe our experience with two cases of penile\nmetastatic Crohn's disease and their management in comparison with other cases\ndescribed in the literature. Both our patients were of the lymphoedematous type\nand had sexual and voiding dysfunction. They were treated with topical and\nintra-lesional steroids and circumcision after unsuccessful systemic treatments.\n\nPMID: 21667047  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

She had been followed up \nfor polymyalgia rheumatica for nearly 10 years. On laboratory examination, ESR:\n62 mm/h and CRP: 16.1 mg/dl. HLA was positive. There was tenderness on both of\nher ankles. We diagnosed late onset spondyloarthropathy according to clinic and\nradiographic findings. The patient was treated with sulphasalazine 200 mg/day and\nindomethacin 100 mg/day. As a conclusion, LoSPA may mimic a variety of rheumatic \nconditions such as PMR and reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.

Ulcerative colitis was diagnosed according\nto endoscopic and histologic findings. She was treated with prednisolone and\nsulfasalazine, and her symptoms disappeared after 1 month. Sulfasalazine therapy \nwas continued for 3 months, and the patient's condition remained stable for 4\nyears. Recently, she was admitted with abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and\nmelena. She was again treated with prednisolone and intravenous\nhyperalimentation, but her symptoms did not improve. Colonoscopy showed multiple \nulcers with bleeding and polyposis and severe edema in the colon. In addition,\nshe had a high blood endotoxin concentration (38.0 pg/ml; normal < 9.8 pg/ml).\nShe underwent polymyxin B-immobilized fiber (PMX-F) hemoperfusion therapy twice. \nAfter 2 weeks, her symptoms resolved completely, colonoscopy showed disappearance\nof the edema, revascularization of the mucosa, and improvement of the ulcers, and\nblood endotoxin concentration decreased to 5.0 pg/ml.

Pediatr Emerg Care. 2010 Feb;26(2):146-8. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0b013e3181d018bc.\n\nSalicylic acid ingestion leading to esophageal stricture.\n\nWaasdorp Hurtado CE(1), Kramer RE.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Children's Hospital, Denver, CO 80045, USA. waasdorp.christine@tchden.org\n\nAccidental ingestion of caustic substances (acid and alkali) occurs more\nfrequently in children than in adults. The subsequent injury varies from minimal \nto severe, with perforation and even death as potential complications. Several\nfactors have been shown to mediate the severity of injury, including the pH,\nconcentration and physical state of the ingested substance, tissue contact time, \nand quantity (volume) of the ingested material. Liquids with a pH of less than 2 \n(acidic) or a pH of greater than 12 (alkali) are considered to be extremely\ncorrosive and hold the greatest risk for injury. Esophageal injury after caustic \ningestion is endoscopically graded with a score of 0 for no injury to IIIb for\nsignificant circumferential injury with ulcers and necrosis. Ingestion of either \na strong alkali or acid has been documented to result in esophageal necrosis and \nulcers (grade IIIb). Alkali ingestions occur more frequently because of their\npresence in daily life (detergents, degreasers) and therefore have more reports\nof injury. Despite more than 8200 documented cases of topical salicylic acid\ningestions annually in US children younger than 19 years, there are no reported\ncases of salicylic acid resulting in gastrointestinal pathology. We report 2\ncases of salicylic acid ingestion resulting in esophageal strictures. Both\npatients had more significant injury than anticipated given their initial\nclinical presentations. Given our recent experience, we recommend close follow-up\nand evaluation for strictures in patients with exposure to salicylic acid.\n\nPMID: 20145508  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We describe an original case\nof accidental poisoning with salicylates topically applied to the scalp of a\n6-week-old infant.\nCLINICAL REPORT: A 6-week-old infant, with no prior history, was admitted to the \npediatric intensive care unit for treatment of severe disorders of consciousness \nassociated with significant tachypnea. Laboratory results revealed metabolic\nacidosis with elevated anion gap, ketonuria, and normal glycemia. Initial\nassessment ruled out the hypothesis of accidental ingestion of salicylates.\nHowever, the presence of salicylic acid derivatives in organic acid\nchromatography, confirmed by plasma salicylate levels at 580 mg/L, ultimately\nre-established the diagnosis. Further inquiry retrospectively highlighted the\nprolonged topical application in occlusion (3 days) of an extemporaneous\npreparation containing 23% salicylic acid on the scalp. The course after urine\nalkalinization was rapidly favorable without sequelae.\nCOMMENT AND CONCLUSIONS: Salicylate intoxication is potentially lethal,\nparticularly in infants under 12 months of age. The vast majority of these\nintoxications result from accidental ingestion. The present observation\nunderscores the original and undescribed risk of intoxication due to a localized \napplication to the scalp. In the presence of warning symptoms, salicylate\npoisoning should be investigated, including topical application of salicylic\nacid, even if localized. Careful attention should be paid to following the\nindications of use of this product in terms of concentration, characteristics of \nthe infant, and exposed skin. The use of extended topical application of\nsalicylic acid in concentrations greater than 3% should be avoided.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The dermatology service was consulted\nfor treatment suggestions of a presumed diagnosis of chronic tinea capitis. Three\ncourses of oral griseofulvin during the past 2 years failed to resolve the\npatient's chronic scalp dermatosis. Scalp lesions first began about 2 years\nearlier after hospitalization for placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump. The \npatient was unable to care for her scalp due to her cerebral palsy, and her\nmother interpreted the scalp condition as infectious. No routine shampoo care,\nscalp care, or topical treatment was performed for more than 1 1/2 years. The\nmother felt that touching the patient's scalp might cause pain and noted that the\nmajority of her time was spent concentrating on more critical medical issues.\nPhysical examination revealed coalescing hyperkeratotic plaques extending\ndorsally from the anterior hairline to the occipital scalp with small flecks of\nkeratinous debris throughout the remaining hair (Figure 1). The plate-like\nplaques were devoid of hair, except at a few fissures where a few tufts of hair\nemerged. No cervical lymph nodes were appreciated on palpation. Treatment was\ninitiated with compresses consisting of large warm water-soaked towels 4 times\ndaily. Three times a day, a nursing staff applied 5% salicylic acid in olive oil \nto the scalp under a shower cap for approximately 1 hour. Over the following 2\ndays, a significant reduction in keratinous debris was appreciated. Within 2\nweeks, the bulk of the plaques had been removed (Figure 2). At 6-week follow-up, \nthe underlying scalp showed areas of fibrosis and possible scarring with a few\nemerging tufts of hair. On the basis of history and response to treatment with\nsalicylic acid and routine scalp care, the patient was diagnosed with an\nunusually severe case of dermatosis neglecta.\n\nPMID: 22324178  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two\nphenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations\nwithin the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT\ninterval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial\nfeatures, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of\nTS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have\ncortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted\nmutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS\nassociated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene\nmutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand\nboth the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nPMCID: PMC3319791\nPMID: 22106044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The extent of the ototoxic salicylate impact is increased by\ndiabetes, renal insufficiency, and alcoholism.\nPATIENT: This study presents a case report of a female patient who suffered a\nrepeated, symmetric, pancochlear, reversible inner ear impairment after two\ntreatments with salicylate containing ointment for psoriasis. The correlation of \nthe salicylate therapy with the observed inner ear lesions is obvious due to the \nclose interval between these incidences and to the audiologic criteria typical\nfor salicylate intoxication.\nCONCLUSION: Audiologic controls should be carried out during extended local\napplication of salicylate containing ointment.\n\nPMID: 9333282  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Until now, few cases of transcutaneous\nsalicylate intoxication have been reported in the literature. Our case report is \nabout a 5-year-old girl with lamellar ichthyosis and an acute salicylate\ntranscutaneous intoxication after the application of a skin ointment. The child\nhad a fever, hyperpnoea with respiratory alkalosis, comatose state and oculogyric\ncrisis. We would like to emphasize the danger of applying salicylic acid in\nchildren with extensive skin diseases and, therefore, it is advisable to measure \nthe plasma salicylic levels so as to prevent eventual salicylate toxicity.\n\nPMID: 9099329  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

High-dose\nacetaminophen has been reported to provoke bronchospasm in aspirin-sensitive\nasthmatic patients.\nCASE HISTORY: We report an asthmatic adolescent female who had anaphylaxis with\n650 mg acetaminophen after tolerating 325-mg doses for years. She subsequently in\nsequence had urticaria with aspirin and ibuprofen, and anaphylaxis with sodium\nsalicylate. She was then challenged with acetaminophen, 325 mg orally.\nRESULTS: Approximately 30 minutes after acetaminophen challenge, she developed\nrhinoconjunctivitis, urticaria, pruritus, cough, and bronchospasm reversed with\nantihistamines and bronchodilators.\nCONCLUSIONS: Aspirin sensitivity has not frequently been described in younger age\ngroups. This patient also had several unusual features in that she presented\nfirst with sensitivity to acetaminophen that was then followed by aspirin\nsensitivity. She had urticaria with both aspirin and sodium salicylate; she had\ncombined pulmonary and cutaneous reactions to both acetaminophen and aspirin,\nwhich are rarely described; and she had anaphylaxis with low-dose acetaminophen.\n\nPMID: 8970436  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient was admitted to the dermatology \nservice with a diagnosis of erythroderma and was treated with salicylate\ncontaining ointments. After six days of treatment the patient became confused and\nparanoid. A serum salicylate was 3.36 mmol/L (46 mg/dL). The patient was admitted\nto the intensive care unit were she was rehydrated and treated with bicarbonate\nand activated charcoal.\nRESULTS: Her serum salicylate fell to 1.90 mmol/L (26 mg/dL) over a two day\nperiod and she regained a normal mental status.\n\nPMID: 8699558  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

She had no history of\ntrauma, seizures, alcohol abuse, hyperthermia, or other possible causative\nfactors for rhabdomyolysis. A high serum salicylate level indicated a diagnosis\nof salicylate intoxication. Medical history after recovery revealed chronic\nsalicylate ingestion for severe headaches. This is possibly the first reported\ncase of rhabdomyolysis caused by chronic salicylate intoxication. Continuous\nhemodiafiltration early in hospitalization was an effective treatment.\n\nPMID: 8182651  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A 72-year-old man with psoriasis and end-stage renal\ndisease was treated with a topical cream containing 10% salicylic acid. The\npatient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia\nrefractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate\nconcentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied\nby rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory \nhypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin.\nSalicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization,\nresulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on\nhypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate.\n\nPMID: 2001141  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The\nhistopathology and ultrastructural pathology were compared to that in two cases\nof Reye's syndrome which were selected because they had been treated with\nsalicylates and had comparable serum salicylate concentrations at the time of\nliver biopsy. Liver biopsy specimens from the cases of salicylate intoxication\nwere nearly normal by light microscopy. Lipid accumulation was minimal, and the\ncontent of glycogen and succinic acid dehydrogenase activity was normal.\nMitochondria and peroxisomes appeared normal. Light and electron microscopy of\nliver specimens from the two cases of Reye's syndrome revealed swollen\nhepatocytes with microvesicular fat and central nuclei. Glycogen content and\nsuccinic acid dehydrogenase activity were diminished. All hepatocyte mitochondria\nwere enlarged, pleomorphic, and had an expanded matrix and no mitochondrial dense\nbodies. The histopathology and ultrastructural pathology of liver biopsy\nspecimens in salicylate intoxication were different from those in Reye's\nsyndrome. In children in whom the diagnosis of Reye's syndrome is obscure, liver \nbiopsy with electron microscopic examination is necessary for definitive\ndiagnosis.\n\nPMID: 6745858  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Epub 2011 \nJul 14.\n\nDisseminated BCG infection mimicking metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in an\nimmunodeficient child with a novel hypomorphic NEMO mutation.\n\nImamura M(1), Kawai T, Okada S, Izawa K, Takachi T, Iwabuchi H, Yoshida S,\nHosokai R, Kanegane H, Yamamoto T, Umezu H, Nishikomori R, Heike T, Uchiyama M,\nImai C.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Pediatrics, Department of Homeostatic Regulation and Development,\nNiigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757\nAsahimachi-Dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.\n\nBACKGROUND: Nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency is a\ndevelopmental and immunological disorder. The genetic and phenotypic correlation \nhas been described.\nMETHODS: We report a unique clinical presentation and the identification of a\nnovel missense mutation in the NEMO gene in a 3-year-old boy with bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin (BCG) infection.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and abnormal\nanti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers, suggestive of EBV-related diseases\nincluding chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, or\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although the biopsy specimen from a nasopharyngeal\nlesion was initially diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, this was changed to\ndisseminated BCG infection involving the nasopharynx, multiple systemic lymph\nnodes, and brain. A novel mutation (designated D311E) in the NEMO gene, located\nin the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain, was identified as the underlying\ncause of the immunodeficiency. Impaired immune responses which are characteristic\nof patients with NEMO deficiency were demonstrated. The patient underwent\nsuccessful unrelated bone marrow transplantation at 4.9\xc2\xa0years of age.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of the NUB domain in host defense \nagainst mycobacteria. The unique presenting features in our patient indicate that\na hypomorphic NEMO mutation can be associated with atypical pathological findings\nof the epithelial tissues in patients with BCG infection.\n\nPMID: 21755389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We report here a case \nof mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder associated with primary\nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old female\nhad been treated with salazosulfapyridine and ursodesoxycholic acid becase of UC \nand PSC. After 7 years of treatment, laboratory data showed that the liver\nfunction took a turn for the worse, and the patient was admitted to our hospital \nfor further examination. Enhanced computed tomography and ultrasonography showed \nan enlarged gallbladder associated with wall thickening and diffuse papillary\nprotrusion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis and dilatation \nof the bile duct, which were compatible with PSC. Under the diagnosis of an early\ncarcinoma of the gallbladder, we performed simple cholecystectomy. The tumor\nshowed a papillary growth pattern located diffusely in the gallbladder with a\nmassive amount of mucin filling the gallbladder. Histologically, it was diagnosed\nas a papillary adenocarcinoma localized in the mucosal layer. To the best of our \nknowledge, this is the first case of mucin-producing carcinoma of the gallbladder\nassociated with PSC and UC. PSC and UC patients should be regarded as a high-risk\ngroup not only for cholangiocarcinoma but also carcinoma of the gallbladder.\n\nPMID: 19096754  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

After discontinuing the \napplication of the assay used (20 pg/ml) and gonadotrophins rose to normal\npostmenopausal levels. These findings prove that after local application of\noestradiol on the scalp, percutaneous resorption of the steroid is significant\nand systemic oestrogen effects have to be taken into account.\n\nPMID: 6148292  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The proband's mother and grandmother have normal skin and\nare of normal intelligence. From his carrier mother, the proband inherited an X\nshort arm (Xp) to Y long arm (Yq) translocation chromosome, with the entire Y\nshort arm and the X short arm terminal segment deleted (Xp223-pter). His cells\nare completely deficient in STS activity, confirming assignment of the STS locus \nto Xp223-pter.

Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing\nglomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. Proteinase\n3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA \nunits (EU) in sera (normal range less than 10 EU), myeloperoxidase-ANCA was\nnegative. PR3-ANCA titer was 250 and 1,070 EU in pleural effusions on right and\nleft side, respectively. Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted \nin improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of C-reactive protein and\nvolume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA\ntiter rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the\npleural effusion remained. One month after steroid therapy, the pleural effusion \ndisappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later. This case suggests\nthat sulphasalazine can induce PR3-ANCA-positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis.\n\nPMID: 19203554  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Akimasa.Sekine@gmail.com\n\nHere, we report 2 cases of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) caused\nby salazosulfapyridine and allopurinol during tuberculosis treatment. Both\npatients also developed multiple drug hypersensitivity (MDH) to several\nantituberculosis drugs that were used at around the period of DIHS onset, and\nthus, the treatment could not be successfully completed. Our cases show that MDH \ncan easily occur after development of DIHS. Considering that treatment for\ntuberculosis requires long-term management with several drugs, it is important to\nrefrain from administering drugs that can cause DIHS during tuberculosis\ntreatment.\n\n2012 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

BMJ Case Rep. 2013 Apr 9;2013. pii: bcr2013008949. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2013-008949.\n\nFever of unknown origin and pancytopenia caused by culture-proven delayed onset\ndisseminated bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection after intravesical\ninstillation.\n\nDammert P(1), Boujaoude Z, Rafferty W, Kass J.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Pulmonary and Critical care Medicine, Cooper University Hospital,\nCamden, New Jersey, USA. pedrodammert@hotmail.com\n\nA 78-year-old man was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma in situ and was\nsuccessfully treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG)\ninstillations. At 6 months after the last dose, he developed fever, weight loss\nand malaise. He had an extensive negative workup at an outside hospital and was\ntreated empirically with ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks. The fever resolved but\nreturned months later and he was readmitted with pancytopenia, elevated alkaline \nphosphatase and ground glass opacities on the chest CT. Bone marrow and liver\nbiopsies showed non-caseating granulomas and were negative for acid-fast bacillus\n(AFB) and fungal stains. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex PCR of the bone\nmarrow was negative. Owing to the high clinical suspicion of disseminated BCG\ninfection, the patient was treated empirically. After 9 weeks of incubation, the \nbone marrow AFB culture grew Mycobacterium bovis. Within 2 months of treatment\nhis symptoms resolved and his laboratory results normalised.\n\nPMID: 23576657  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Mikrobiyol Bul. 2010 Apr;44(2):297-302.\n\n[A case of fatal disseminated infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain \nand the identification of the isolate by spoligotyping].\n\n[Article in Turkish]\n\nAslan G(1), Kuyucu N, Aydin E, G\xc3\xbcnal S, Emekda\xc5\x9f G.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Mersin Universitesi Tip Fak\xc3\xbcltesi, Tibbi Mikrobiyoloji Anabilim Dali, Mersin.\ndrgaslan@mersin.edu.tr\n\nThe vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG may lead to disseminated infection in \npatients with immune deficiency. In this report a patient who developed fatal\ndisseminated tuberculosis caused by M. bovis BCG strain was presented. One year\nold male patient with the previous history of recurrent lower respiratory tract\ninfection, was admitted to the hospital with the complaints of fever, cough and\ndiarrhea continuing for 20 days. There was no family history of tuberculosis or\nhistory of contact with a tuberculosis case. Physical examination of the case\nrevealed growth retardation and reticular and reticulonodular infiltration was\ndetected in his chest X-ray. The results of sweat test, cystic fibrosis gene\nmutation analysis and metabolic screening tests were normal. Since fever\ncontinued and infiltrations persisted in the chest X-ray despite antibiotic\ntherapy, PPD test was applied and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were investigated in\nhis gastric aspirate and stool samples for three consecutive days. PPD test was\nnegative and no AFB were detected in the microscopic examination of the clinical \nsamples. However, growth in Lowenstein-Jensen medium was detected in the stool\nsample on the 38th day of incubation. The antimycobacterial susceptibility\ntesting performed at BACTEC MGIT (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube) 960 system\n(Becton-Dickinson, USA) revealed that the isolate was susceptible to rifampin,\nisoniazid, streptomicin and ethambutol. Since the isolates did not grow at PNB\n(para-nitro benzoic acid) medium and niacin and nitrate activities were negative,\nspoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing) was performed and DR loci\ncharacteristic for M. bovis BCG strain were detected. However, the patient died 2\nweeks before the culture results were obtained. The effective use of\nmycobacteriology laboratories and cooperation between laboratory and clinics\nprovide advantages in the early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis cases,\ndecreasing the morbidity and the mortality.\n\nPMID: 20549966  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Clinically, an infantile kala-azar\nor lymphoma/leukemia was suspected. However, after thorough clinical and\nparaclinical investigations, the case was diagnosed as a disseminated BCG\ninfection. The child died 2 weeks after starting antituberculosis treatment.\nAutopsy revealed diffuse histiocytic infiltration in the liver, spleen, and\nmesenteric lymph nodes, which were loaded with acid-fast bacilli. Three\ninteresting findings were noticed in this case: circulating monocytes in the\nperipheral blood were loaded with ghost acid-fast bacilli; bone marrow smears\nrevealed numerous Gaucher cell-like macrophages loaded with negative images of\nMycobacterium tuberculi; and there was extensive marrow necrosis. These findings \nhave not been previously reported in the literature.\n\nPMID: 15701985  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A total of 220 patients have been included in a review of local and\nsystemic side effects associated with BCG immunotherapy. The majority of side\neffects are mild and self limiting, but potentially life threatening\ncomplications can arise with BCG immunotherapy. These systemic side effects\ninclude pneumonitis/hepatitis and systemic BCG infection. Recommendations are\ngiven for the use and administration of BCG, and if these rules are correctly\napplied, BCG may be administered safely, and with confidence.\n\nPMID: 1396946  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In both cases, salazosulfapyridine\n(SASP) was administered to treat the diarrhea. One patient was a 14-year-old male\nwith acute myelogenous leukemia who received SCT from a related HLA-identical\ndonor. The leukemia recurred early, and a second SCT from the same donor was\nperformed approximately half a year later. Because intestinal graft-versus-host\ndisease (GVHD) was observed, steroids and octreotide were administered, but the\nsymptoms were not improved. Thereafter, SASP was administered, and the symptoms\nremitted 9 days later. The other patient was a 12-year-old male with chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia who received SCT from an unrelated HLA-identical donor.\nDiarrhea and abdominal pain developed early after engraftment and did not respond\nto either steroids or tacrolimus. Oral administration of SASP was initiated on\nday 236, and the diarrhea remitted 4 days later without recurrence thereafter.\nSASP may be effective in children for the digestive system symptoms of chronic\nGVHD.\n\nPMID: 15646661  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A skin biopsy showed hydropic degeneration of keratinocytes and\nlymphocytic infiltrate. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated an increased number\nof macrophages with hemophagocytosis. Although serologic tests for Epstein-Barr\nvirus (EBV) indicated a previous infection, EBV deoxyribonucleic acid was\ndetected in her serum by polymerase chain reaction. Cessation of sulfasalazine\nand administration of steroids led to dramatic improvement. This case illustrates\nthat the hemophagocytic syndrome associated with reactivation of EBV can occur as\npart of drug hypersensitivity reactions in RA patients taking sulfasalazine.\n\nPMID: 17952482  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Sulfa drugs can cause a wide range of\nallergic and hypersensitivity reactions and occasionally can lead to a fulminant \nillness. In the case under discussion the patient had hepatotoxicity, skin rash, \nfever, and peripheral blood atypical lymphocytosis. Initial impressions suggested\nthe possibility of a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. Flow cytometry of\nperipheral blood and a bone marrow biopsy provided clear evidence for a reactive,\npolyclonal process as opposed to a malignant disorder. Cessation of the offending\ndrug and administration of steroids led to dramatic improvement. This case\nillustrates that drug hypersensitivity reactions can be manifested by an extreme \nlymphocytoid leukemoid reaction.\n\nPMID: 13680174  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

So we then\nchose the combined treatment of intralesional BCG and intravenous\nbeta-Interferon. Monthly intravenous administration of beta-Interferon has\nreached a total of 8,000,000 I/U, while the BCG has been inoculated\nintralesionally in the submucosa in doses of 0.1 ml after observing the negative \nresult of the PPD test. Our aim was to achieve double immunological stimulation\nby combining two drugs that are often used separately with satisfactory results. \nBefore and after every therapy cycle, the immunological status was established,\nand showed a small but constant and permanent increase in T-lymphocytes, both\nhelper and suppressor. Histological results before and after therapy and\nimmunological responses are reported, and the case distinguishes itself by its\nbrilliant results.\n\nPMID: 2667811  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The infecting organism can be traced to an\nintraneoplastic injection of bacille Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) vaccine into a\ncutaneous malignant melanoma nodule 14 months before aneurysm detection (17\nmonths before operation). Treatment consisted of aneurysm excision, in situ\nprosthetic graft placement, and antituberculous medications.

He died with widespread miliary\ngranulomas, most likely representing disseminated BCG infection. However, at\nautopsy, the patient was found to have a minimal tumor burden and only a single\nfocus of visceral metastatic malignant melanoma. In view of the clinically\ndocumented aggressive nature of this patient's disease, the arrested growth of\nhis tumors is best attributed to the beneficial effect of BCG immunotherapy.\n\nPMID: 3532854  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Metoclopramide was used as an\nantiemetic. During the second therapy cycle sudden severe vascular collapse with \nincreasing hepatomegaly and signs of acute hepatic failure occurred leading to\ndeath after two days. At necropsy a Budd-Chiari syndrome with thombosed hepatic\nveins and congestive liver parenchyma necroses was found. The cause was\nhyperergic endophlebitis combined with severe infiltration of the vascular walls \nby eosinophilic granulocytes. In association with 5 more similar cases from other\nclinics (personal communications) this picture must be assumed to be a\ncomplication of dacarbazine treatment.\n\nPMID: 6986251  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

S'\n1. Gastroenterology. 1978 Sep;75(3):492-6.\n\nIproclozide fulminant hepatitis. Possible role of enzyme induction.\n\nPessayre D, de Saint-Louvent P, Degott C, Bernuau J, Rueff B, Benhamou JP.\n\nThe authors report the cases of 3 patients who died from fulminant hepatitis\nafter receiving iproclozide, a hydrazine-containing monoamine oxidase inhibitor. \nFulminant hepatitis in these patients resembled that reported in patients\nreceiving other hydrazine-containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors: (1) the 3\npatients were women; (2) the monoamine oxidase inhibitor has been ingested for 1 \nmonth or more; (3) the main clinical manifestations were jaundice and disorders\nof consciousness; (4) hypersensitivity manifestations were absent; (5) the\npredominant liver lesion was necrosis; (6) all 3 patients died. In our 3\npatients, jaundice occurred 7 to 10 days after the adjunction to iproclozide of a\nmicrosomal enzyme inducer. These observations suggest that concomitant\nadministration of iproclozide and of microsomal enzyme inducers may produce\nfulminant hepatitis in man. It is speculated that iproclozide could be, like\niproniazid, transformed into a hepatotoxic metabolite, the production of which\nwould be increased by microsomal enzyme induction.\n\nPMID: 680506  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient had no\nprevious history of tuberculosis. Because of persistent inflammation and painful \nswelling of the epididymides and testes, the patient underwent bilateral\norchiectomy. This case demonstrates the late adverse effects that can occur after\nintravesical BCG therapy, which in our patient ended in surgical removal of both \ngonads.\n\nPMID: 15667898  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. Ryumachi. 2003 Jun;43(3):569-76.\n\n[Pharmacokinetics of salazosulfapyridine in a hemodialysis patient].\n\n[Article in Japanese]\n\nAkiyama Y(1), Fujimaki T, Sakurai Y.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Rheumatology, Saitama Medical School, Moroyama-machi, Iruma-gun,\nSaitama.\n\nThe patient was a 62-year-old female. Total gastrectomy was performed due to\ngastric ulcer in 1969. She was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 1985 and\nwas developed to amyloidosis in 1991. She was started on hemodialysis (HD) for\nchronic renal failure in 1996. In 1998, her arthralgia was aggravated, and 100\nmg/day of bucillamine was administered on the day of HD. Her arthralgia\npersisted, and switching to salazosulfapyridine (SASP) was considered. As there\nwere no standards and no reports for the use of SASP in HD patients, we examined \nthe pharmacokinetics of SASP and its metabolites, and compared our patient with\nthe results of phase one study in normal subjects in Japan. In this case, the\nblood concentration of SASP was similar to that in healthy controls after single \nadministration of 500 mg of SASP on the day of non-HD, while the concentration of\nsulfapyridine (SP) was higher than that in healthy donors. However, the blood\nconcentrations of SASP, SP, and N4-acetyl-SP (AcSP) at 24 hours after\nadministration were similar to those obtained in healthy men. SASP was not\ndialyzed, while about half of SP and AcSP, were dialyzed. In a five-day\nconsecutive administration study also, the blood concentrations of these\ncompounds on Day 5 were similar to those of phase one study, suggesting no\naccumulation. No adverse drug reaction was observed. As this case had the past\nhistory of total gastrectomy and amyloidosis, it is possible that this result is \ninfluenced by the factors. Therefore it is necessary to examine pharmacokinetics \nof SASP and its metabolites beforehand when administering this agent to other\nHD/RA patients.\n\nPMID: 12910967  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Renal\nbiopsy specimens showed histological changes consistent with drug induced chronic\nintestinal nephritis. Extensive investigation made other causes of chronic renal \nfailure unlikely. One of these patients underwent renal transplantation, the\nother has impaired but stable renal function.\n\nPMCID: PMC1379424\nPMID: 1353741  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

We describe a case of\nHSgammadeltaTCL with a leukaemic course in a patient with Crohn's disease who had\nreceived azathioprine during the previous 5.5 years. Sinusoidal infiltration by\natypical lymphocytes was observed in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and the\ntypical cytogenetic abnormalities (isochromosome 7 and trisomy 8) were found. The\npatient did not respond to intensive chemotherapy. This case shows the importance\nof ruling out HSgammadeltaTCL in patients with hepatosplenomegaly, B-symptoms and\nany immunosuppressive condition.\n\nPMID: 12688327  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The leukocyte differentiation revealed 54% medium-size immature\nlymphocytes. The majority of lymphocytes showed the B-cell characteristics of\nIgGk monoclonality, and CD19+ and CD20+ in cell surface phenotype, suggesting a\nB-cell malignancy, non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the leukemic phase. Arthropathy\nassociated with lymphoid malignancy was suspected. However, the infiltrated\nleukocytes in the synovial fluid of the left knee joint were dominantly\nneutrophils and CD3+ T-cells, and compatible with the findings in rheumatoid\narthritis (RA). The association of B-cell malignancy and RA is not frequently\nreported. We discuss the common underlying immunological abnormalities in both\nB-cell malignancy and RA.\n\nPMID: 9144020  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Despite\ncontinued treatment with prednisolone and salazosulfapyridine, as well as\nazathioprine and metronidazole, no lasting remission was obtained. Widespread\nsevere osteoporosis with vertebral fractures made it necessary to discontinue the\nprednisolone, despite endoscopically and biochemically confirmed signs of\nactivity of the disease. Administration of cyclosporin A in this situation\nproduced phases of improved clinical and biochemical parameters. Regular control \nof biochemical levels failed to reveal any drug-specific acute side-effects.\nBecause of the increased incidence of malignant lymphoma under cyclosporin A this\ndrug should be held in reserve in the treatment of Crohn's disease, until results\nfrom controlled studies have become available.\n\nPMID: 2857635  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

An 18-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of\nfever, skin rash, dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. She had been given\nsalazosulfapyridine for two weeks to treat Crohn's disease. A chest radiograph\nand computed tomographic scan showed multiple nodular shadows in both lung\nfields, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and bilateral pleural effusions. Cessation\nof salazosulfapyridine followed by corticosteroid therapy led to an immediate\nsymptomatic improvement. The drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test for\nsalazosulfapyridine was negative. The same symptoms reappeared with rechallenge\nof SASP, however, which led to diagnosis as salazosulfapyridine-induced\npneumonitis. This is apparently the first case report of\nsalazosulfapyridine-induced pneumonitis with a radiographic pattern of multiple\npulmonary nodules; accumulation of similar case reports are needed to confirm the\nassociation.\n\nPMID: 17233389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We describe the clinical presentation of a\nmale newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease who was found to have an asymptomatic\npulmonary lesion on imaging studies. Pulmonary complications have been previously\ndescribed in inflamatory bowel disease being more common in ulcerative colitis\nthan in Crohn's disease; these can involve the lung parenchyma, the\ntracheobronchial tree, and the pleura. The true prevalence and etiology of these \nlesions is currently unknown and are not necessarily associated with bowel\ndisease activity. Abnormal pulmonary functions test have been reported during\ninflammatory bowel disease exacerbations, and although pulmonary findings can\npresent with a variety of symptoms, subclinical presentations have also been\ndescribed. Pulmonary manifestations are usually steoid-responsive, as was the\ncase in our patients.\n\nPMID: 14716424  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

It is still a widely used\nanti-inflammatory agent especially in the treatment of rheumatologic disorders\nand inflammatory bowel diseases. Most of its side effects are benign, tolerable, \nand dose dependent, but less common severe systemic reactions have also been\nrevealed.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was\nadmitted to emergency service because of status epilepticus. Hepatitis and\nmyelotoxicity were also present after laboratory investigations. The patient was \non sulfasalazine treatment for 3 weeks with a daily dose of 2g. Cranial magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral periventricular and subcortical\nlesions in the white matter of especially temporal and occipital regions.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed very high protein level (564 mg/L). \nAfter discontinuation of treatment, the clinical, CSF, and MRI findings regressed\nrapidly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Side effects of sulfasalazine include neurotoxicity such as status\nepilepticus, cranial MRI lesions, and CSF abnormalities that were diagnosed in\nour patient after excluding other etiologic factors causing encephalitis.\n\nPMID: 19050416  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

She presented with fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy,\nand hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed a marked increase of atypical\nlymphocytes in the peripheral blood and biphasic hepatic dysfunction. IM-like\nsyndrome can be caused by various drugs, including SASP, and the concept of\ndrug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome has been proposed recently. IM-like\nsyndrome due to SASP has been reported in patients taking higher dosages for the \ntreatment of inflammatory bowel disease, but has not been reported earlier in\npatients with RA. The results of the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test\ntests suggested that 5-aminosalicylic acid was a possible causative metabolite.\nThis severe type of drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction mimicking IM due to\nSASP should be granted wider awareness in the field of rheumatology, because the \ndrug is widely used for the treatment of RA.\n\nPMID: 18084702  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

The patient met the\nInternational Headache Society's criteria for idiopathic intracranial\nhypertension. Sulphasalazine was discontinued and the patient was given\nazathioprine for ulcerative colitis and acetazolamide for intracranial\nhypertension. Three weeks later, her examination was normal and lumbar puncture\nrevealed an opening pressure of 180-mm H(2)O. Sulphasalazine is a product of 5\naminosalicylate (5 ASA) and there seems to be a relationship between the\nadministration of sulphasalazine and the onset of intracranial hypertension\nsymptoms.

Eight years earlier he had presented a\nsimilar episode which had regressed spontaneously. The neurological examination\nrevealed a tetraparesis with areflexia and hypotonia. These manifestations were\nconcomitant with chronic diarrhea which had been neglected to date. The\nelectrophysiological aspect was compatible with an acute polyradiculoneuritis.\nThe analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed an albumino-cytological\ndissociation. The existence of the diarrhea directed the investigations towards\nan inflammatory enteropathy, which was attested later on by the endoscopic,\nradiologic and histological data leading to the diagnosis of active Crohn's\ndisease. The diagnosis of a relapsing polyradiculoneuritis associated with\nCrohn's disease was retained. The patient was treated by salazopyrine-budesonide \nwith improvement in the digestive and neurological manifestations after 3 years.\nCONCLUSION: The frequency of neurological features in Crohn's disease is not well\ndocumented. The incriminated mechanisms are either directly related to the\ndisease (deficit in B12 vitamin or folic acid and/or by the means of an\nauto-immune vascularitis) or secondary to long-term treatment with metronidazole.\nThe course of neurological manifestations is largely dependent on the course of\nthe inflammatory disease.\n\nPMID: 17351546  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

A severe systemic granulomatous reaction to sulfasalazine \nin patient with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nQuallich LG(1), Greenson J, Haftel HM, Fontana RJ.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann\nArbor, Michigan 48109, USA. lquall@umich.edu\n\nBACKGROUND: Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the\ntreatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders.\nAlthough as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible,\ndose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic\nreactions have also been reported.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine developed in a\n21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis characterized by eosinophilia,\ngranulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures.\nThe clinical course and management of this patient are presented as well as a\nreview of the incidence and outcome of severe systemic reactions to\nsulfasalazine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old\nfemale within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis.\nFollowing a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her\ncholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no \nresidual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to\nsulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware\nof unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.\n\nPMCID: PMC56591\nPMID: 11570976  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

At day 21 and day 10 respectively, pharyngitis, rash, and fever were\nnoted. During the following days, high-grade fever persisted, while jaundice,\nsevere cytolysis and acute liver failure also occurred. Drug hepatotoxicity was\nsuspected and salazopyrin was withdrawn on day 29 and day 24 respectively.\nDevelopment of hepatic encephalopathy led to urgent liver transplantation in both\ncases.\nCONCLUSION: Salazopyrin is a possible cause of fulminant immunoallergic\nhepatitis. Prompt therapeutic interruption is urgent, but it may not alter the\noutcome and or preclude the need for liver transplantation. We suggest that\nsalazopyrin therapy be avoided in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease whenever\npossible, and that the use of pure amino-salicylates be preferred.\n\nPMID: 10394456  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

She had routinely taken loxoprofen sodium because of severe\nheadache. Emergent colonoscopic examination revealed ulceration of the cecum.\nAfter administration of loxoprofen sodium was discontinued and administration of \nsulfasalazine was initiated, her intestinal bleeding subsided. Two months after\ndiscontinuation of loxoprofen sodium, the colonoscopic examination revealed scar \nformation at the site of cecal ulceration. In this case, it was conceivable that \nthe administration of loxoprofen sodium might have induced colonic ulceration.\n\nPMID: 10337935  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

X-ray examination revealed sclerosis of the right sacroiliac\njoint, and of the 6th lumbar vertebra. An NMR examination revealed a diffuse\nsignal loss in the region of the 6th lumbar vertebra. On account of the\nprogressive increase in liver transaminases in the serum, an ERCP was carried\nout, which confirmed the suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Severe\naxial arthritis and PSC with underlying clinically inactive ulcerative colitis\nwas diagnosed, and treatment with salazosulfapyridine and ursodeoxycholic acid\ninitiated.

Myositis\npreceded the clinical manifestations of colitis. Both symptoms responded promptly\nand rapidly to sulfasalazine. Serum creatine phosphokinase was markedly elevated \nand returned to normal after treatment. Muscle biopsy and electromyography were\nnondiagnostic. Myositis may be more common than reported in patients with\ninflammatory bowel disease. Careful attention to muscle pain and serum level of\ncreatine phosphokinase in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is suggested.\n\nPMID: 2872796  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Muscle biopsy showed a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and atrophic\nmuscle fibres, but no granulomata or vasculitis, and her symptoms responded to\nhigh-dose steroids. Twelve months later she underwent subtotal colectomy for\ntroublesome symptoms and incidentally was discovered to have an adenocarcinoma of\nthe sigmoid colon. Myositis without granulomata has not been reported previously \nin either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\nPMID: 2866130  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

In both instances there was an interval of three\nweeks between receiving the drug for the first time and the onset of the toxic\nreaction. In the first patient, hepatotoxicity occurred after initial exposure\nand following the second course of sulphasalazine. Mild neurotoxicity was seen\nfollowing second exposure to sulphasalazine. In the second patient,\nhepatotoxicity occurred following the initial exposure to sulphasalazine but\nafter reexposure the only abnormality in liver function tests present was a\nslight rise in the serum level of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. In this patient,\nlife-threatening neurotoxicity occurred each time that the patient received\nsulphasalazine.\n\nPMID: 6123306  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Hinduja National Hospital & Medical Research\nCenter, V.S Marg, Mahim (w), Mumbai-16, India.\n\nWe studied the clinical profile, laboratory parameters, disease course, and\noutcomes of patients with adult onset Still's disease (AOSD). A retrospective\nanalysis of adult patients with Still's disease diagnosed from 2000 to 2004 was\ncarried out. Their clinical features and laboratory findings at presentation,\ndisease course, and outcomes were analyzed. Data of 14 patients with Still's\ndisease were analyzed. The age at disease onset ranged from 16 to 59 years with a\nmean of 29.85, the male to female ratio being 9:5. The mean duration of illness\nfrom onset of symptoms to presentation was 14.5 months (range). The most common\nclinical manifestations were fever (n = 14), articular symptoms (n = 14), rash (n\n= 8), weight loss (n = 12), and sore throat (n = 5). Elevated ESR was present in \nall patients with a mean of 98.3 mm at 1 h. Hepatic enzymes were elevated in\nseven patients at disease onset. The mean duration of follow up was 19.14 months \n(range). Three patients progressed to chronic arthropathy. Cyclosporine led to\ndramatic recovery in five patients. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was\npresent in two patients, one after sulfasalazine therapy. One patient with MAS\ndied. Still's disease, although uncommon, has characteristic constellation of\nclinical and laboratory features and should be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of fever of unknown origin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nsteroids, and methotrexate may not be always effective, and cyclosporine is an\neffective drug in resistant cases. Sulfasalazine should be avoided in cases of\nAOSD.\n\nPMID: 17701269  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

The syndrome\nis defined by the clinical triad of fever, skin rash and internal organ\ninvolvement and can be life-threatening condition. We describe three patients\ntreated in our institution. The first was a 32-year-old man who developed toxic\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) with pulmonary and liver involvement after initiation \nof lamotrigine therapy for concomitant epilepsy. The second 32-year-old man was\ntreated with salazopyrine and omeprazole in order to relief the symptoms of\ninflammatory bowel disease, but as a result developed toxic epidermal necrolysis \nwith elevated liver enzymes. The third patient was a 28-year-old man with long\nhistory of alcohol abuse who began treatment with carbamazepine and a few days\nlater he was admitted to the clinic with symptoms of severe disseminated skin\nrash. The patients had peripheral eosinophilia. All the patients needed urgent\nlife-saving therapy, intensive care and nursing. The culprit drug was\ndiscontinued and prompt systemic therapy with corticosteroids at an initial dose \nof 2 mg/kg/d and with broad spectrum antibiotics was started. Topical therapy\nincluded spraying Av\xc3\xa8ne thermal water and local antiseptics. Resolution and\nepithelization of skin erosions were observed in about 4 weeks after the\ninitiation of the therapy. Medications can give rise to certain adverse reactions\nincluding serious cutaneous and systemic involvement. TEN is a rare complication \nof DHS. Patients who develop DHS need optimal and adequate treatment. The\nconcomitant use of corticosteroids and broad spectrum systemic antibiotics is\nessential. The local therapy plays an important part in relieving symptoms and\nshould consist of mild preparations with minimally sensitizing potential.\n\nPMID: 17673387  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 40-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis\nwas admitted to a local hospital 26 days after initiation of sulphasalazine\ntreatment. She had fever, lymphadenopathy, dermatitis and facial oedema and\nshowed biochemical signs of progressive hepatitis. Peripheral blood counts showed\nelevated leucocyte count with 15% atypical plasmacytes. Lymph node biopsy showed \naltered follicular architecture, a diffuse CD 4 positive predominance and\nhistiocytes with erythrophagocytosis. Investigation by gene rearrangement for\nclonality of B- and T-lymphocytes ruled out the suspicion of lymphoma.\nHaematological and near-fatal hepatological changes resolved following\ndiscontinuation of sulphasalazine and a three-week course of glucocorticoid\ntherapy. Early awareness of this syndrome via measuring liver function tests on, \ne.g., days 14-35 in patients started on sulphasalazine is recommended.\n\nPMID: 17032600  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Two weeks after starting treatment, a high degree, subcontinuous fever\noccurred, together with systemic discomfort, fatigue, headache, and ultimately a \nmoderate wakefulness impairment. Upon admission to the hospital, a malar rash\nbecame evident. Modest notes of hepatotoxicity were also evident. All of the\nsymptoms suddenly resolved after SSZ withdrawal. The markers of hepatitis become \nnegative just 2 months later. It is interesting to note that after dismissal, in \norder to counteract the severe arthritic conditions and the presence of a type 2 \ndiabetes, a combined therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporin had to be used,\nwith no renal or hepatic side effects and remarkable therapeutic effects. No\nmarkers of autoimmunity were found in this patient. The chronology and the\nclinical events here described may confirm the hypothesis of a idiosyncratic\nreaction to SSZ, closely resembling a rare, sometimes irreversible, condition\nknown as "the 3 week sulphasalazine syndrome".\n\nPMID: 14976471  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

S'\n1. J Clin Gastroenterol. 1985 Oct;7(5):400-4.\n\nUlcerative colitis in association with chronic paranoid schizophrenia: a review\nof steroid-induced psychiatric disorders.\n\nAlcena V, Alexopoulos GS.\n\nA 21-year-old schizophrenic man developed ulcerative colitis. Because he might\nhave needed steroids, we reviewed the literature on the use of steroids in\npatients with psychiatric disorders. The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms\nduring steroid therapy is unknown. Development of psychiatric complications in\npatients receiving steroids is probably dose-dependent. The type of psychiatric\nmanifestations is variable, ranging from affective through schizophreniform\nsyndromes. It is unclear whether a history of psychiatric disorders increases the\nrisk for psychiatric problems from steroids. In the majority of patients\npsychiatric complications remit when the dose of steroids is reduced or\ndiscontinued, or when appropriate pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are\nadministered. Preliminary studies suggest that lithium may prevent development of\nsteroid psychosis.\n\nPMID: 2866212  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Later she was found to be HLA-B27-positive in keeping with a\nspondyloarthropathy. Soon afterward, she developed clinical myopericarditis and\ncardiogenic shock that responded initially to methylprednisolone and intravenous \nimmunoglobulin, but recurred. An endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated active\nmyocarditis with a mixed cell composition including rare giant cells, but not\nenough to classify it as giant cell myocarditis. Heart failure symptoms returned \nand she eventually required a heart transplant; the explanted heart showed giant \ncell myocarditis.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Both\npatients also developed multiple drug hypersensitivity (MDH) to several\nantituberculosis drugs that were used at around the period of DIHS onset, and\nthus, the treatment could not be successfully completed. Our cases show that MDH \ncan easily occur after development of DIHS.

Box 40047, Jeddah 21499, Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia. amindaoulah@yahoo.com\n\nDrug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome represents one\npattern of the cutaneous involvement in type IV hypersensitivity reaction to\ndrugs. It is a severe, delayed, idiosyncratic reaction presented as rash with\nfever, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. There are several reported\ncases of sulfasalazine-induced DRESS syndrome, but myocardial involvement was\nrare. High index of suspicion is needed in every patient receiving these drugs\nfor prompt diagnosis and early management. We report a case of a 56-year-old\nwoman treated with sulfasalazine for ankylosing spondylitis for 3 weeks, which\nwas discontinued after development of DRESS syndrome. Despite treating her with\nhigh dose of steroid and cyclosporine, her symptoms persisted, and ultimately,\nshe developed toxic myocarditis with a misleading presentation of acute\nST-elevated myocardial infarction. The diagnosis was made based on postmortem\nhistopathologic finding.\n\nPMID: 21514761  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In this case, discontinuation of the\ntreatment and cautious switch to another 5-ASA compound should be tested.\n\nPMID: 17440739  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Initial treatment with cyclophosphamide and\nsteroids achieved complete remission. Subsequent relapse with marked retinal\nvasculitis at first was refractory to the standard treatment. Renewed remission\nwas obtained with additional infliximab, and was maintained with azathioprine for\n12 months before the patient again presented with symmetrical polyarthritis.\nINVESTIGATIONS: Clinical examination revealed a symmetrical polyarthritis\ninvolving the joints of the hand and fingers. The acute-phase parameters were\nraised, the rheumafactor was highly positive. Radiology showed early erosions in \nthe bones of the hand. There were no indices of renewed activity of the\nChurg-Strauss syndrome.\nTREATMENT AND COURSE: These findings indicated sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis\nand methotrexate was started, later supplemented with sulfsalazine and\nhydroxychloroquine because of continuing signs of activity. Infliximab was again \ngiven because of further progression, but a severe infusion reaction developed\nduring the second infusion. After changing to etanercept remission of the\nrheumatoid arthritis was achieved.\nCONCLUSION: The development of rheumatoid arthritis during remission achieved\nwith azathioprine in Churg-Strauss syndrome of four-year duration is very rare.\nRepeated dosis of infliximab at long intervals greatly increases the risk of an\nintolerance.\n\nPMID: 16118729  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Multiple organs can be\ninvolved. Entero-Beh\xc3\xa7et's disease is often uncontrollable, relapsing, and can\ncause acute intestinal bleeding or perforation. We utilized a combination therapy\nincluding 600 mg of pentoxifylline per day, in two doses, to treat three female\npatients and observed the subsequent changes in clinical symptoms, serum C\nreactive protein levels, and endoscopic findings.

Cervical and inguinal\nlymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis,\nassociated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates,\nwithout viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week\nlater, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of\nanti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and\naccompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened.

Her past medical\nhistory consisted of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis, asthma, and ulcerative\ncolitis. Warfarin concentrations had consistently remained within the therapeutic\nrange with dosages of approximately 30 mg per week. In an attempt to treat\narthritis, her gastroenterologist replaced 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) with\nsulfasalazine 1000 mg four times daily. Subsequent to the medication changes, the\ninternational normalized ratio (INR) decreased and remained at subtherapeutic\nconcentrations despite increases in the warfarin dosage. During this period, the \npatient developed a deep-vein thrombosis in the right popliteal vein. The INR did\nnot return to an acceptable level until six weeks after sulfasalazine was\nstarted. The new warfarin dosage was 75 mg per week, a 250% dosage increase. When\nsulfasalazine was discontinued and 5-ASA reinstituted, the warfarin dosage\nrequirements to achieve therapeutic INRs returned to weekly dosages of\napproximately 45 mg.\nDISCUSSION: Sulfonamides have been well documented to enhance the anticoagulant\neffect of warfarin. This patient developed a new deep-vein thrombosis due to\nfailure in maintaining therapeutic INR levels after the recent introduction of\nsulfasalazine. We suspect that she developed warfarin resistance secondary to\nconcomitant use of sulfasalazine. This patient demonstrated warfarin resistance\nas opposed to enhanced anticoagulant effect with sulfasalazine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians managing warfarin therapy should exercise caution when\nsulfasalazine is added to a patient's medical regimen. This case suggests a\npossible warfarin-sulfasalazine interaction that resulted in warfarin resistance.\n\nPMID: 11098339  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Pericarditis\nas a side effect induced by sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, drugs used in\nthe therapy of these diseases, was first described only 7 years ago. In older\ncase reports the relationship between the use of these drugs and pericarditis is \nunclear. We analyze the reported cases of 68 patients (38 men, 24 women) with\nulcerative colitis (n = 45) or Crohn's disease (n = 15) who had one or more\nepisodes of pericarditis or myopericarditis. Pericarditis was not associated with\nhigh activity of bowel disease in all cases. In most cases therapy with\ncorticosteroids led to uneventful recovery. In drug induced pericarditis omission\nof the 5-ASA therapy was sufficient in a few cases. There was one fatal case\n(with myocarditis). The decision whether pericarditis is a symptom of the\nunderlying disease or a side effect of the drug used for the treatment of the\ndisease is not always easy. We present an analysis (clinical problem solving) of \na pertinent observation in a patient with Crohn's disease and pericarditis,\nshowing the dilemma of pericarditis in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and its\ntherapy.\n\nPMID: 9005529  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

There are increasing reports, however, of false-positive c-ANCAs, usually\nin the setting of other vasculidities. We report a case of a 27-year-old man with\nulcerative colitis who developed pulmonary symptoms, peripheral nodular lung\ninfiltrates, and an elevated c-ANCA suggesting WG. Chest CT and open lung biopsy \nspecimens were consistent with WG. The symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates\nresolved after discontinuation of sulfasalazine therapy. The c-ANCA remained\nelevated due to the occurrence of false-positive values in ulcerative colitis.

Recently a severe allergic reaction and cases of\nlupus-like disease have been described in patients with RA after treatment with\nsulphasalazine. We describe five patients, all with inflammatory arthropathy who \ndeveloped cutaneous vasculitis, lupus-like disease or atypical serology after\nexposure to sulphasalazine. Three of four cases investigated were found to have\nthe slow acetylator phenotype. These reactions can complicate the diagnosis and\ndelay discontinuation of the drug. Moreover, present guidelines for the diagnosis\nof drug-induced lupus do not apply to the majority of patients with\nsulphasalazine-induced lupus.\n\nPMID: 7788172  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Occupations requiring prolonged\nstanding and forceful use of hands may be seriously compromised by this\ncondition. The severe forms of the disease are usually unresponsive to\nantihistamines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and patients frequently \nrequire corticosteroids for control of symptoms.\nOBJECTIVE: It was the purpose of this report to evaluate the clinical utility of \nsulfasalazine for two patients with refractory delayed pressure urticaria.\nMETHODS: Sulfasalazine, starting at 500 mg/day (with weekly incremental dosing to\na total of 4 g), was administered to two patients with disabling pressure\nurticaria and angioedema (symptomatic daily with normal activities) who had\nfailed all other reported therapeutic options except corticosteroids.\nRESULTS: Patient A required daily prednisone in excess of 30 mg (for more than 6 \nmonths) to control his painful angioedema sufficiently in order to continue\nworking as a colorectal surgeon. Patient B also experienced daily symptoms for\nmore than 1 year. Both patients tolerated sulfasalazine to a dose of 4 g/day\nwithout adverse reactions and achieved complete resolution of symptoms. Patient A\ncontinued to be well controlled 1 year after starting but must maintain a dose of\n2 g or greater per day. Patient B reported excellent control 6 months after\nstarting but was subsequently lost to follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine, in doses used for inflammatory bowel disease, appears \nto be an effective alternative therapy for delayed pressure urticaria and\nangioedema in patients poorly controlled by traditional treatment and may act as \na corticosteroid-sparing agent.\n\nPMID: 7697475  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

In the two men the protein C\ndeficiency was diagnosed only after the onset of severe thromboembolic\ncomplications (cavernous sinus thrombosis; pulmonary embolism) during heparin\ntreatment. But in the woman protein C activity was measured immediately after\nhospital admission (in the knowledge of the first two cases) even before heparin \nadministration was started. All three patients received treatment with\nsulphasalazine (3 g daily) and fluocortolone (60 mg daily), as well as full\nheparinization (22,500-36,000 IU daily). Protein C activity returned to normal on\nremission of the ulcerative colitis (in one case only after subtotal colectomy). \nThese case reports show that acquired protein C deficiency can be reversed by\nrigorous treatment of the underlying disease.\n\nPMID: 1347501  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Here, we report two sisters with a fatal course of PNP deficiency due\nto delay in diagnosis. The first patient developed a liver abscess by Aspergillus\nfumigatus and the second patient developed Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\nlymphadenitis and probable pulmonary tuberculosis due to disseminated BCG\ninfection. The patients also suffered from sclerosing cholangitis. Mutation\nanalysis of the PNP gene from both sisters revealed a homozygous mutation for a\nG>A at nucleotide 349 (349 G>A transition), which changes alanine 117 to\ntheronine in exon 4 (A117T). An increased awareness of early signs, symptoms, and\nabnormal laboratory findings of PNP deficiency will establish the early prognosis\nand treatment.\n\nPMID: 19657670  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

Splawski et al. [2004] previously described two\nphenotypes associated with TS distinguished by two unique and different mutations\nwithin the CACNA1C gene. We report on a newborn who presented with prolonged QT\ninterval and associated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, dysmorphic facial\nfeatures, syndactyly of the hands and feet, and joint contractures, suggestive of\nTS. He developed a stroke, subsequent intractable seizures, and was found to have\ncortical blindness and later profound developmental delay. Initial targeted\nmutation analysis did not identify either of the previously described TS\nassociated mutations; however, full gene sequencing detected a novel CACNA1C gene\nmutation (p.Ala1473Gly). The clinical and genetic findings in our case expand\nboth the clinical and molecular knowledge of TS.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nPMCID: PMC3319791\nPMID: 22106044  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Fitzgerald@dcpah.msu.edu\n\nBovine leukosis associated with infection with the delta retrovirus Bovine\nleukemia virus (BLV) is endemic in many cattle herds in the United States.\nInfection has been associated with immunosuppression and decreased productivity. \nCases of tuberculosis in cows due to infection with Mycobacterium bovis reemerged\nin Michigan in 1998, and despite intensive eradication attempts, new cases of\nbovine tuberculosis are sporadically identified. The present report details a\ncoinfection with BLV and M. bovis in a Holstein cow from Michigan that presented \nas part of a bovine tuberculosis screening program. Peripheral and visceral lymph\nnodes of this animal were markedly enlarged, homogeneously pale white, and bulged\non the cut surface. The submandibular, mesenteric, and caudal mediastinal lymph\nnodes contained multifocal to coalescing caseogranulomas that ranged from 1 to 5 \ncm in diameter. Histologically, dense sheets of monomorphic populations of\nneoplastic lymphocytes obliterated the normal architecture of all lymph nodes.\nCaseogranulomas were characterized by central pools of amorphous degenerate\neosinophilic and occasionally mineralized granular debris surrounded by thick\nrims of epithelioid macrophages, occasional Langhan's type giant cells, and\nfibrosis. Polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for BLV. Cultures of\naffected lymph nodes yielded growth of M. bovis.\n\nPMID: 19901295  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n"

We report 3 similar BCG infections in children and describe\nevidence of respiratory transmission to health care workers (HCWs) from 1\npatient. These children were receiving chemotherapy for leukemia when they\npresented with active tuberculosis. Each isolate was identified biochemically and\nby both gas-liquid chromatography and major polymorphic tandem repeat-polymerase \nchain reaction. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that 2 isolates were\nidentical strains and identical to the Tice and Connaught strains licensed in the\nUnited States for bladder chemotherapy. The third isolate differed by a single\nfragment after DraI restriction. One patient with heavily positive sputum exposed\nnumerous HCWs. Of 41 HCWs, 2 (5%) converted their purified protein derivatives\n(PPD) skin test. These data underscore the risk of nosocomial BCG transmission by\ncontamination of chemotherapy solutions and demonstrate the potential for\ntransmission to HCWs from patients with active pulmonary disease.\n\nPMID: 10671341  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Clin Infect Dis. 1992 Mar;14(3):662-5.\n\nMycobacterial brain abscess possibly due to bacille Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin in an\nimmunocompromised child.\n\nCoppes MJ(1), Olivieri NF, Howes M, Pusic M, Gold R, Richardson SE.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nDisseminated infection with bacille Calmette-Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG) is rare, even in\nimmunocompromised patients who receive BCG injections as immunotherapy or\nimmunization. When such infection occurs, it is usually in patients with\ndecreased cellular immunity. A 6-year-old Caucasian girl who was receiving\nmaintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with symptoms\nof meningitis. A temporal-lobe biopsy revealed acid-fast bacilli that were\nidentified as Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Neither the patient nor any family members\nhad been immunized previously. Appropriate therapy resulted in a complete\nrecovery.\n\nPMID: 1562657  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

Epub 2011 \nJul 14.\n\nDisseminated BCG infection mimicking metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in an\nimmunodeficient child with a novel hypomorphic NEMO mutation.\n\nImamura M(1), Kawai T, Okada S, Izawa K, Takachi T, Iwabuchi H, Yoshida S,\nHosokai R, Kanegane H, Yamamoto T, Umezu H, Nishikomori R, Heike T, Uchiyama M,\nImai C.\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Division of Pediatrics, Department of Homeostatic Regulation and Development,\nNiigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757\nAsahimachi-Dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.\n\nBACKGROUND: Nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency is a\ndevelopmental and immunological disorder. The genetic and phenotypic correlation \nhas been described.\nMETHODS: We report a unique clinical presentation and the identification of a\nnovel missense mutation in the NEMO gene in a 3-year-old boy with bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin (BCG) infection.\nRESULTS: The patient presented with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and abnormal\nanti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers, suggestive of EBV-related diseases\nincluding chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, or\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although the biopsy specimen from a nasopharyngeal\nlesion was initially diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, this was changed to\ndisseminated BCG infection involving the nasopharynx, multiple systemic lymph\nnodes, and brain. A novel mutation (designated D311E) in the NEMO gene, located\nin the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain, was identified as the underlying\ncause of the immunodeficiency. Impaired immune responses which are characteristic\nof patients with NEMO deficiency were demonstrated. The patient underwent\nsuccessful unrelated bone marrow transplantation at 4.9\xc2\xa0years of age.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of the NUB domain in host defense \nagainst mycobacteria. The unique presenting features in our patient indicate that\na hypomorphic NEMO mutation can be associated with atypical pathological findings\nof the epithelial tissues in patients with BCG infection.\n\nPMID: 21755389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'

A 72-year-old man with psoriasis and end-stage renal\ndisease was treated with a topical cream containing 10% salicylic acid. The\npatient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia\nrefractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate\nconcentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied\nby rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory \nhypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin.\nSalicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization,\nresulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on\nhypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate.\n\nPMID: 2001141  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n'
