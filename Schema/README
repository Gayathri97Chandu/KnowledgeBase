OHDSI KB v.02 

Conceptually, the data model is a hybrid relational/RDF schema where
the RDF component applies the Open Data Annotation (OA) model
(http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) to represent specific
evidence items for or against an association between a drug and a
health outcome of interest (HOIs) from any of a variety of sources,
and the relational component provides a summary and index for drug-HOI
evidence represented in the RDF component.

The relational component enumerates the evidence data sources and
provides counts for the records associated with every drug-HOI pair in
each source noting the modality of the association (i.e., a positive
or negative association). Associated with the counts from a given
source is a URL that can be used in the RDF component to pull back a
list of OA records typed using custom OHDSI evidence types. Each OA
record provides data that client programs can use to render data about
the source of the evidence (the "target") and the semantic tags used
to identify the record as a source of evidence for a drug-HOI pair
(the "body" or "bodies").

This model decouples the data sources from the variouss copies of the
sources that might have been processed in many different ways. It also
decouples what can be said about and evidence item (i.e., the semantic
tags) from the information artifact. All of this allows for greater
flexibility with respect to inclusion of sources and
analysis. Moreover, the 'drill down' use case can be supported by
following URIs provided by in the 'evidence target' table to Linked
Data resources.

This model will be developed to support all of the sources here:

EXAMPLE QUERIES:

-- A general query showing how to bridge all tables
SELECT `drug`,`HOI`,`evidence_type`,`evidence_count`,`evidence_linkout`,evidence_sources.title, evidence_sources.description
FROM `drug_HOI_evidence`, evidence_sources
WHERE evidence_source_code_id = evidence_sources.id


-- Get back all evidence for 'Lisinopril' and 'Uterine leiomyoma' using standard vocab codes
SELECT *
FROM drug_hoi_evidences  
WHERE 
drug = 1308216 AND
hoi = 36617553;


-- Get back all evidence for 'amoxacillin' and 'Pruritis' using
-- standard vocab codes. Returns the following linkout that can be put
-- into the browser to retrieve an OA representation of the data in
-- the product label:
-- http://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu/l/index.php?id=i9b  
SELECT *
FROM drug_hoi_evidences  
WHERE 
drug = 19123591 AND
hoi = 37320197;


------------------------------------------------------------ 
-- Queries below this line need to get ported but first the
-- Evidence_sources table needs to be revised to tag each evidence
-- source with a type such as literature, labeling,
-- pharmacovigilance_signal_spontaneous_reporting,
-- pharmacovigilance_signal_EHR
------------------------------------------------------------
-- Count literature evidence for 'metronidazole' and 'renal failure'
SELECT COUNT("drug_HOI_evidence".evidence_type)
FROM "drug_HOI_evidence"
WHERE 
drug = 1707164 AND
"HOI" = 37019318 AND
evidence_type LIKE 'literature%'


-- Count case report evidence for 'metronidazole' and 'renal failure'
SELECT COUNT(evidence_type)
FROM "drug_HOI_evidence"
WHERE 
drug = 1707164 AND
"HOI" = 37019318 AND 
evidence_type = 'literature_case_report'


-- get the target URIs for product label evidence for Simvastatin and Upper respiratory tract infection
SELECT evidence_targets.uri
FROM "drug_HOI_evidence", evidence_targets
WHERE 
"drug_HOI_evidence".drug = 1539403 AND
"drug_HOI_evidence"."HOI" = 36110715 AND
"drug_HOI_evidence".evidence_type = 'product_label' AND
evidence_targets.id = "drug_HOI_evidence".evidence_target_id
