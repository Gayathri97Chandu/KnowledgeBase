From the GUI...

Use Triads

Vocabularies:
MDR;MSH;SNOMEDCT_US;ICD9CM;RXNORM

I then ran noblecoder on the first 100 lines of the text column of the CT
gov stuff....

I then ran nobletools to 

Nobletools is getting a lot of results back without semantic types

Semantic Types I found Useful....
- Event
- Pathological Function
- Functional Concept
- Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction
- Finding
- Sign or Symptom
- Individual Behavior
- Disease or Syndrome
- Mental Process

Depression is mapped to many semantic types

Adverse is not tagged but events is. So Assumption is that all events
are adverse avents. We can get the severity of events (serious, etc.) if
we also account for qualitative concepts.

Pulmonary is a qualitative concept....
Sensory is a qualitative concept..
neuro-sensory never tagged

Other notes... Other shows up a lot....
Also NOS versions of the word are tagged
