Should work fine for everyone that wants to run. All input and&\#x0A;output goes into ctgov-inout folder.</message>\n<message>Moved the java files to a better package representation.</message>\n<message>Added an xlsx file to the knowledgebase for the v3 CUIs run.</message>\n<message>Changed the program to look at all results in Nobletools to get more&\#x0A;CUIs. Previously it was just the first result. However, this could bring&\#x0A;down the precision of the CUIs but gets words like &quot;Diarrhea&quot; an&\#x0A;accurate CUI. The output is in *_CUIs_v3*.</message>\n<message>Did not consider lowercase for the exact string Mesh matching but now I&\#x0A;am.</message>\n<message>Created a mostly functioning CUI adder using exact string mapping and&\#x0A;Nobletools from Pitt&apos;s DBMI</message>\n<message>Reran the mesh exact matcher to retrieve cuis, still not getting all&\#x0A;cuis. Seems all the ones that don&apos;t get matched are actually drug names&\#x0A;(again).</message>\n<message>Had to move MeSHMapper to the default package since it needs to run on&\#x0A;the dev server....</message>\n<message>removed the import in meshmapper since it&apos;s redundant&\#x0A;</message>\n<message>Eliminating the language restrictions on the mesh serializer</message>\n</messages>
