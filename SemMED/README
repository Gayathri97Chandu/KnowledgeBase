connectSEMMED.py contains the function details()
- returns a dict to use mysql.connector to connect

selectPredicates.py
- selects the unique predicates from the SemMED db table PREDICATION 
- output:
	- allpredicates.txt
		- first line is the # of entries
		- rest is all unique predicates

the other py script is just a test to see if the connector can connect...

Potentially useful predicates (including the negative ones...):
- TREATS
- COEXISTS_WITH
- AFFECTS
- CAUSES
- USES
- PREVENTS
- INTERACTS_WITH
- COMPLICATES
- DISRUPTS
- INHIBITS
- AUGMENTS
- STIMULATES

Problems:
- tables are case sensitive!
- PREDICATION table has 15176516 entries..........
	but.... 57 unique strings...
	dunno why this inefficient... must be important though? Or maybe the dump
	severely messed up...
